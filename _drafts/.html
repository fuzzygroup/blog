<p>Wow.  Well I am extraordinarily pleased to announce this ...</p>
<p>The new Feedster 500 is live.</p>
<p>Let me repeat that ....</p>
<div><a href="http://top500.feedster.com/">The new Feedster 500 is live</a>.</div>
<p>Now when I picked up the reins of the <a href="http://www.calacanis.com/2005/08/02/the-blog-500-challenge-prize-50-000-in-advertising-or/">500 Challenge</a> from Jason back in August, I certainly didn't envision this:</p>
<ul>
<li>tagging in Feedster</li>
<li>a tag cloud in Feedster</li>
<li>organizing the Feedster 500 into a folksonomy created initially by us but allowing anyone to tag the top 500 and organize it as they see fit</li>
<li>writing and testing multiple scoring algorithms</li>
<li>having to tie the scoring algorithms into our back end anti spam technology</li>
<li>repeatedly crunching the raw data on over 17 million blogs</li>
<li>14 pots of iced coffee</li>
<li>going back to spending an utterly embarassing amount of time grinding this out.  See my <a href="http://fuzzyblog.wordpress.com//">personal blog</a> for what shipping this has been like.</li>
<li>87 diet cokes</li>
<li>working out what amounts to an API to the Feedster 500 to mash up</li>
<li>an amount of less than nourishing food that, well, my mother would be horrified to know that I ate</li>
<li>an ajax enabled add tag engine</li>
<li>having to anticipate and defuse tag spam in advance with our captcha engine</li>
<li>getting an awesome contractor, my buddy <a href="http://airhead.typepad.com/">Mike</a>, to build a look and feel for this that, well, isn't sucky like Feedster's normal look and feel (hey -- I'm a founder and the guy who implemented our look and feel and it is sucky; but stay tuned its being fixed)</li>
<li>getting help from others in the Feedster organization like <a href="http://www.socklabs.com/">Nick</a> who wrote our Tag Cloud, Alan who's managing our community relations and will be reading and responding to whatever you have to say about the Feedster 500 and <a href="http://www.jamesgross.com/">James</a> who did an outstanding job  of QA on the Feedster 500 -- not just were there broken links or typos but actually thinking about "Did the results make sense" and then beating me around the head with a wet noodle when they didn't</li>
</ul>
<p>I mean, honestly, I wrote the first version of this because:</p>
<ol>
<li>I wanted to respond to Jason since I respect him and value his input</li>
<li>That week in August I was, well, bored and worn out from the Splog Wars and I figured this would be a nice diversion.  I certainly didn't expect all this.  ***boggles the mind***</li>
</ol>
<p>Behind the Scenes</p>
<p>Whenever you implement a list, people are always going to comment on it and ask "Why wasn't I there?" and, honestly, I've already donned my asbestos underwear because I'm actually expecting to get flamed to a toasty crisp.  But, and this is an important but, I actually very proud of this list.  Its a great Top 500 that showcases not only the diversity of the blogosphere but also the great content out there.  Just look at the <a href="http://top500.feedster.com/">tag cloud</a> on the right side of the Top 500 and you can easily see what's going on at a glance -- and, bear in mind, that these tags were all applied by Feedster staff.  Our expectation is that when the people who own these blogs and the people who read them start tagging them then it'll get even richer.</p>
<p>So you're probably thinking something like "well that's all well and good but how the heck did they do this?"  Well we took our original Top 500 code and looked at some of the key issues with it.  Now the basis of our Top 500 scoring is link popularity but we found that while the blogosphere is all about currency, we were using a straight link measure so things that had a lot of links in the past but had fallen out of favor with the blogosphere were showing up too often.  This let us to what we call our "Adjusted Links" measure which weights recent links more heavily.  We also apply a number of heuristic rules like "this blog may meet the link score criteria but the author has stopped updating so its really not relevant anymore".  Now something we got roundly criticized for in the last time was our reliance on a domain based approach which meant that people on hosted services which used paths to identify users weren't showing up.  This meant that a great Live Journal blog like <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/jwz/">JWZ</a> wasn't even in our list.  I'd love to tell you that this was fully addressed in this release but it wasn't.  In order to solve this, Feedster's going to need to restructure some database tables which are currently measuring in the 50 gig range and that just wasn't in the cards right now.  What we did do however was analyze enough of the data that we made a partial solution so at least some of the really great bloggers on hosted services showed up.  I know this is an issue and I think we'll be able to lick this one in the next Top 500.</p>
<p>The Scoble Question</p>
<p>Oy.  Since the last Top 500, Scoble moved his blog from scoble.weblogs.com to <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/">scobleizer.wordpress.com</a>.  You could argue this one as "He moved his blog so reset his score to 0 and let Ghu sort it out".  And I took this seriously enough to discuss it with my co-founder, Francois.  But, in the end, Scoble's well Scoble -- and he's about the best blogger I know and I didn't think that a Top 500 list without him was valid.  In the end we made a human, not algorithmic, decision and that was the right call.</p>
<p>The Weblogs, Inc Dilemma</p>
<p>One of the things we saw as we analyzed the data is that blogs from Weblogs, Inc has a striking showing in all this.  Their link scores are higher than anyone elses -- they've got 4 blogs in the top 10 alone.  Now you might think that's surprising but Weblogs, Inc is a network and they've built a densely interlinked mesh network of content.  They show up strongly in the Top 500 because the way they chose to model their content is very similar to ours.  And, given that Jason truly inspired the Feedster 500, I suspect we're going to look for ways to evaluate clusters of affiliated links much more closely in the next Top 500.    But I certainly can't fault him for it -- he provides great content and an outstanding experience.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>So that's the Feedster 500.  Leave comments, questions and other things here and we'll do our best to get them addressed.  Me?  I'm going to try and sleep for longer than 2 hours tonight.</p>
<p>One Final Question ...</p>
<p>So what do you think <a href="http://www.calacanis.com/">Jason</a>?  Did we win your challenge yet ?</p>
