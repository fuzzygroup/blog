title: Scott's Approach to Agile Project Planning in the Large
---
Here are the basic precepts:

* Color coding matters - people, unless they have a color sight issue, your visual cortex is great at distinguishing things visually
* The calendar matters fundamentally
* People are the fundamental resource
* Your fundamental block of time is the MONTH with a secondary block of time being the WEEK
* Swim lanes are by WEEK not by project / function
* Heavy slack integration
