I took the time recently to help a friend get up and running with doing development on Rails under windows.  They were using the WSL i.e. Linux under Windows and it all proceeded mostly pretty smoothly.  

Here were the key resources that they used:

* [Chris Oliver's Go Rails on Windows](https://gorails.com/setup/windows/10). Highly Recommended
* [Nick Janetakis on Using WSL on Windows as a Dev Environment](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/using-wsl-and-mobaxterm-to-create-a-linux-dev-environment-on-windows)
* [Hanselman on Rails on Windows](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/RubyOnRailsOnWindowsIsNotJustPossibleItsFabulousUsingWSL2AndVSCode.aspx)
* [Stack Overflow on MySQL on Windows](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52487644/install-mariadb-in-windows-subsystem-linux-wsl)
* [FindShank on MySQL on Windows](https://www.findshank.com/2018/09/15/Install-mysql-on-wsl/)
