As I begin typing this, It is 2:26 am.  It is, depending on your perspective, either a Saturday morning (or a very, very late Friday night).  I am in my office and, once again, I have insomnia -- and I am on my laptop, coding away.  I am, without question, a **workaholic**.

I am 51 years old and as I put fingers to keys, I have a message for fellow tech folk and it is simple:

> **Work is a 40 hour a week commitment**.

Now it might seem like a bit of personal dishonesty to be writing code
