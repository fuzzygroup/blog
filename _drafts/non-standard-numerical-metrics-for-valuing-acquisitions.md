title: Non Standard Numerical Metrics for Valuing Acquisitions
---
As you're aware my knowledge of the marina business is very limited these days -- I live in Indiana.  The one thing that I was concerned with is that Safe Harbor doesn't have enough open positions:

BYY has I think actually more:

Over the years I've done a fair bit of work with venture capitalists helping them with due diligence and one of the ways I learned to look at companies was by their non obvious numerical metrics.  Example - if you look at the number of parking spaces a company has and then multiply by an average salary it gives you their staffing costs.  Similarly if you look at parking lots in silicon valley and you see that no one is working late / after hours, it says something about their drive to succeed (this is mostly true in pre publicly held companies).  

Anyway I would tend to take the position that any company of a sufficient size has some level of structural turn over -- if you have 1,000 people on staff, not all of them, by definition, can be happy.  So some measurably percentage should be in flux at any time and I would think that the number of open positions should reflect that.

Anyway you know your business and you know how many staff they should have and the seasonality.  I don't know if the number of open positions they have is right or wrong but from an external perspective it feels low to me.

Much love and congratulations again.  My very, very best to everyone.
