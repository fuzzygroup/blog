So my wife just said to me "My sister , Kristi, wants to write a blog" and that's how this post got started.  It is 2017 and if you want to create a blog, what tool should you use?  The way that I look at it there are four viable tools, among the myriad options, to consider:

* Blogger
* Wordpress
* Medium
* Jekyll

Each of these is discussed below.

# Blogger

Blogger has a venerable position within the blogging world.  Originally the creation of Ev Williams who later went on to create Twitter and Medium, Blogger is really the grandfather of hosted blogging tools.  Currently owned by Google, Blogger is simple, easy to use and probably the quickest way to get started in blogging.

All you need to use Blogger is a google account such as a gmail login.  If you want to use Blogger then just click this link:

[Visit Blogger] (https://www.blogger.com/about/?r=1-null_user)

Here's a quick step by step walk through of what using Blogger to create a new blog and put a new post on the Internet looks like:

# Jekyll

I didn't create that one post sample blog for Jekyll.

I left Jekyll for last because Jekyll is the hardest tool to use by far
