I don't care how permissive / how liberal a parent you are, I suspect that you would have problems with your relatively young kid (let's say **under** 18) going into a place like this:

I look at putting the Internet into your home without some kind of Internet filtering as analogous to letting your kids walk into a place like this and not stopping them.  In the rest of this post I'll talk about Internet filtering and the first ever product, Disney Circle, that I've found is worth using

# My Credentials to Even Write This

On a personal level I am a husband and father (two sons, 16 and 10).  I'm also a software engineer who has been active on the Internet since the pre-web days and I've spent a large amount of my professional life dealing with spam and bad actors on the Internet.  Finally I'm a firm believer in free speech and as my wife might comment, I'm the furthest thing from a prude in any way, shape or form.  Those last two points, free speech and not being a prude make this a hard post for me to write as I am generally philosophically opposed to Internet filtering.  Now, that said, I would never let my kid walk into a place like that pictured above and I don't think you should either -- what happens there is an adult activity and there is a reason why its actually illegal to be in there if you're under 18.
