title: Postgres Basics for the MySQL Faithful

tags: ["mysql", "postgres"]

While I have been resolutely faithful to MySQL ever since 1999, forces keep conspiring pull me towards Postgres.  And, since its in the context of a training course I chose to pay for out of my own pocket, it is time to suck it up and learn.  Alas.  

Here are the basics that I've been able to learn so far:

* mysql: "show tables<ENTER>" ==> postgres: "\dt <ENTER>"
* mysql: "mysql -uroot -pPASSWORD database" ==> "psql -Upostgres workshop_dev"
* mysql: "ctrl+c" ==> postgres: "\q"
* 
* 
*
