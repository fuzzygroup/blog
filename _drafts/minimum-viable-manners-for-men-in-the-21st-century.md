title: Minimum Viable Manners for Men in the 21st Century
category: life

Within high tech circles, the term MVP stands for "minimum viable product" and it means the absolute minimum product that you can usefully bring to market.  When speaking with my wife the other day, I coined the term "minimum viable manners" to represent the bare bones set of manners with which a man needs to treat a woman in the 21st century.

## Disclaimer

I have to admit, from the onset, that I am going to get this wrong on at least some aspect.  Just to give you context that illustrates my thinking, this is being written by a white male, born in 1967. 

## Reviewers

I asked some of my best female friends and the women I respect the most to review this before I published it.  Thanks to:

* Shelley Johnson
* Lisa Meece
* Professor Jeana Jorgensen
* Dr. Elaine Thompson

## Manner #1: Respect

As I look out at the world of women today, one of the fundamental mistakes I see men make is they simply don't respect woman as people.  Whenever I think about this, I'm always reminded of Captain Mal Reynolds when he said "We're all just folk now".  That's how men need to respect woman -- they are just folk, just like men.

## Manner #2: Pay Attention and Notice Things

## Manner #3: Pay Attention to Your Date

I see this a lot 

## Manner #4: Listen Not Solve
