title: Becoming an Online Content Rockstar Using Udemy and Other Tools
category: udemy
tags: ["udemy", "ebooks"]

At the time of writing this, I currently make $0 from online content and an impressive $0 from Udemy.  I also haven't produced a single video using a computer since the mid 1990s.  Now with that embarrassing truth out of the way, in this post I'm going to cover how to be an **Online Content Rockstar**.  While I haven't done this yet:

* I've been blogging and creating high quality free content since 2002
* I'm an acknowledged expert in a number of high demand areas -- ruby, aws and other niche technical topics
* I have some more general but still niche areas of expertise that might appeal to wider audiences
* I've built interactive training material (and a whole computer based training environment) not once but three times - HyperWriter for Training, Mascot Network and the eduFire online video learning system
* I have an incredible ability to write quickly and generate content easily; between August 2016 and mid October 2016, I've produced over 75,000 words of written, articulate technical content.
* I have a secret weapon -- a friend who has honestly astonished me with the amount of money he makes in online content -- and has been incredibly gracious in answering my questions and giving me feedback.  Thank you!

# Business Structure

**Disclaimer**: I am not an accountant.  Here are some interesting thoughts my friend shared with me:

I didn't set anything up, just acting as a sole proprietor. I asked a bunch of questions to my accountant and he recommended I stay with that until I have employees. I'm not a tax wizard but he made it seem like this will result in me paying the least amount of fees and taxes per year. Even though it's actually a lot of taxes because you have to pay both income tax and "small business" tax.

Udemy deposits everything to PayPal, so does LeanPub. Both do it on a monthly basis and it's to my personal bank account.

This is my first year on Udemy so I'm not sure what will happen. Supposedly if you have over $20,000 in sales AND 200 separate payments then PayPal will report your income to the IRS, but if it's just one or the other they might not do anything. Full details can be found at https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/irs6050w. With the platform model our volume will be very low (12 payments for Udemy, 12 for LeanPub).

Write offs are about the same as consulting too. For example I was able to write off a trip to Boston last June because I went to a tech meetup.

There are a few things I need to ask my accountant tho, such as Udemy takes 50% off your revenue. Technically this is a fee you pay them. I doubt you can write that off, but it's worth a shot because it's a substantial amount of money. I know for sure if Udemy charged $500/month to be on their platform instead of a % cut you would be able to write that off as an expense.




# How You Get Paid - Ways You Can Sell Your Digital Content

Here are a variety of sources you can use to monetize your digital content along with people I respect who use them:

* elixirsips.com - Josh Adams - [getdpd.com](http://www.getdpd.com)
* contribsys.com - Mike Perham - [plasso.co](https://plasso.co/)
* no one I know but very cool - [stripe.com](http://www.stripe.com/)
* leanpub.com - this is a specific way to sell ebooks.  It won't handle screencasts or other media types but it is outstanding for ebooks.

# Video and Audio Production Techniques

This is the single biggest area where I have problems.  Here are a bunch of suggestions:

* Mic.  Get a Blue Yeti mic.  These are solid hardware that work great.
* Turn down the gain on your mic.  When its too high you get bad audio results.
* Place a wash cloth underneath your mic to isolate it from the noise of typing on your keyboard.

# Marketing Techniques

## Build Your Own Brand -- Always

One of the very real problems, as a content producer, with a platform like Udemy is that you have no access to your customer data.  Udemy doesn't disclose email addresses or any contact info to you.  This means that you can't reach out to customers with special offers.  And it means that you don't have any way to reach out to them so you have to come up with ways for them to **want** to reach out to you.

Here are some ways to build your brand even if the platform you're using doesn't encourage it:

* footer on every slide that shows your overall url
* wear a name tag in your videos that has your url on it
* wear a baseball cap in your videos that has your url on it
* wear a shirt that has your url on it
* wear a consistent visual something -- for me it is always Hawaiian shirts -- I've been wearing them, sun, rain or show now since the mid 90s -- so much so that in one of the few videos I've made so far, I describe myself as "owns a lot of Hawaiian shirts"
* offer something that they can only get from you.  A software developer named Mike Perham has what he calls "Friday Happy Hour" where he gives free support for the open source community version of his code.  He has a consistent one hour block every friday that he sets aside for helping people free of charge.  This is a brilliant strategy.  When I do get my content built out, I intend to do the *exact same thing*.

## Bitly for Tracking

If you don't have a bitly account and you're doing online marketing then you likely should.  Bitly allows you to convert urls to a trackable format.  For example I mostly write in the form of blog posts, each of which is accompanied by a tweet announcing it.  Bitly allows me to know how many clicks each of those have tweets have received.  And while I use bitly for blog posts, it could also be used for Udemy or other content.
