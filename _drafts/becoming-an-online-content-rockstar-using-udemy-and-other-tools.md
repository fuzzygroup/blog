title: Becoming an Online Content Rockstar Using Udemy and Other Tools
category: udemy
tags: ["udemy", "ebooks"]
---
At the time of writing this, I currently make $0 from online content and an impressive $0 from Udemy.  I also haven't produced a single video using a computer since the mid 1990s.  Now with that embarrassing truth out of the way, in this post I'm going to cover how to be an **Online Content Rockstar**.  While I haven't done this yet:

* I've been blogging and creating high quality free content since 2002
* I'm an acknowledged expert in a number of high demand areas -- ruby, aws and other niche technical topics
* I have some more general but still niche areas of expertise that might appeal to wider audiences
* I've built interactive training material (and a whole computer based training environment) not once but three times - HyperWriter for Training, Mascot Network and the eduFire online video learning system
* I have an incredible ability to write quickly and generate content easily; between August 2016 and mid October 2016, I've produced over 75,000 words of written, articulate technical content.
* I have a secret weapon -- a friend who has honestly astonished me with the amount of money he makes in online content -- and has been incredibly gracious in answering my questions and giving me feedback.  Thank you!

# Business Structure and Business Tips

**Disclaimer**: I am not an accountant or a lawyer but I have had multiple businesses of my own over the years in various structures - sub S, llc and sole proprietorship.  So these are some practical tips.

* I started my first company in 1987, when I was a teenager in college, as a Sub S corporation so I could take advantage of passing business losses thru to my personal taxes. This is the best advantage of a C corp which has opted to Sub S.  I'm not a fan of LLC because they have higher yearly filing fees (I think its 500 but I could be wrong; this stuff changes).  One thing that has changed radically since 1987 is that the amount of government regulations your business is subject to have increased **dramatically**.  Businesses are now subject to local, state and federal regulations.  And if you employ people in multiple states you are subject to **each** state's screwy regulations and regular periodic filing fees.  It is for this reason that my next time around I

  * don't plan to have a structure at all; just a sole proprietorship
  * don't plan to ever have employees at all; perhaps 1099 contractors although I'd be tempted to only hire people outside the U.S. specifically to NOT have to ever deal with issuing 1099 paperwork

* Expense everything
* Tie work into personal travel so at least something becomes expensable.
* Udemy deposits everything to PayPal, so does LeanPub.  Both do it on a monthly basis to your personal bank account.
* It would be interesting, once I'm making money from Udemy, to see if you can treat their %age as a marketing cost.

# How You Get Paid - Ways You Can Sell Your Digital Content

Here are a variety of sources you can use to monetize your digital content along with people I respect who use them:

* elixirsips.com - Josh Adams - [getdpd.com](http://www.getdpd.com)
* contribsys.com - Mike Perham - [plasso.co](https://plasso.co/)
* no one I know but very cool - [stripe.com](http://www.stripe.com/)
* leanpub.com - this is a specific way to sell ebooks.  It won't handle screencasts or other media types but it is outstanding for ebooks.

# Video and Audio Production Techniques

This is the single biggest area where I have problems.  Here are a bunch of suggestions:

* Mic.  Get a Blue Yeti mic.  These are solid hardware that work great.
* You may also want to get a lavalier USB mic.  
* Turn down the gain on your mic.  When its too high you get bad audio results.
* Place a wash cloth underneath your mic to isolate it from the noise of typing on your keyboard.
* [Shawn Hesketh has an excellent overview of screencasting](https://shawnhesketh.com/create-screencasts/) with tons and tons of wonderful tips.
* [Using QuickTime to Make Screencasts On the Cheap](http://www.cultofmac.com/245619/record-your-macs-screen-for-free-with-quicktime-player-os-x-tips/)

# Marketing Techniques

I'm going to start with my two favorite definitions in the field of marketing and sales:

* Marketing is the creation of demand for a product or service.
* Sales is the execution of strategies to fulfill demand for that product or service.

As a general rule of thumb, marketing **precedes** sales.  If you're using a platform like Udemy, your sales process is handled automatically for you as is your marketing but there are still things you can do to help with marketing.

## Build Your Own Brand -- Always

One of the very real problems, as a content producer, with a platform like Udemy is that you have no access to your customer data.  Udemy doesn't disclose email addresses or any contact info to you.  This means that you can't reach out to customers with special offers.  And it means that you don't have any way to reach out to them so you have to come up with ways for them to **want** to reach out to you.

Here are some ways to build your brand even if the platform you're using doesn't encourage it:

* footer on every slide that shows your overall url
* wear a name tag in your videos that has your url on it
* wear a baseball cap in your videos that has your url on it
* wear a shirt that has your url on it
* wear a consistent visual something -- for me it is always Hawaiian shirts -- I've been wearing them, sun, rain or show now since the mid 90s -- so much so that in one of the few videos I've made so far, I describe myself as "owns a lot of Hawaiian shirts"
* offer something that they can only get from you.  A software developer named Mike Perham has what he calls "Friday Happy Hour" where he gives free support for the open source community version of his code.  He has a consistent one hour block every friday that he sets aside for helping people free of charge.  This is a brilliant strategy.  When I do get my content built out, I intend to do the *exact same thing*.

### Detailed Example of How to Get Your Own Customers From our Course and Possibly Consulting Revenue

Here's what I'm planning to do:

At the end of each lecture for a course, I plan to have:

* a  url for a specific landing page for that course 
* a email address specific to that course like myemail+coursename@domain.com

On the landing page there would be:

* a FAQ
* a mailing list sign up form
* a support email address like myemail+coursename@domain.com
* any git resources or downloadable files for the course
* errata about the course 
* mention of your office hours 
* mention of your ad hoc consulting rate

There needs to be an auto responder on that email address which automatically replies with how to get support.  If you're offering the happy hour like I discuss above then that is only once per week so if people need help prior to that they might be willing to pay for it.

Note: If someone needs ad hoc help in a hurry then that consulting rate should be higher than an ongoing consulting arrangement.  Think of it as a fedex rate versus U.S. Mail.  When you need something immediately then you pay more.  Otherwise you wait and pay less.

## Bitly for Tracking

If you don't have a bitly account and you're doing online marketing then you likely should.  Bitly allows you to convert urls to a trackable format.  For example I mostly write in the form of blog posts, each of which is accompanied by a tweet announcing it.  Bitly allows me to know how many clicks each of those have tweets have received.  And while I use bitly for blog posts, it could also be used for Udemy or other content.


==============

Yeah I didn't just figure this stuff out overnight. It was trial and error over 4 courses, each time I learned something new. Other important things are remembering your exact positioning between recordings (both you and your mic) so you always sound the same across 1 course.

I actually have a course/book in the works now that goes into "how to publish a course".

Yep the discounts are relentless too, and a lot of coupons last well after the promo, for example if you googled for udemy coupons you'll find a ton of 40-90% off coupons. A lot won't work but a lot do. It's easy to find coupons 365 days a year and Udemy trains students to buy on discounts only.

Yeah you can create multiple streams, that's essentially what I'm doing now and moving towards in the near future.

My future courses will be designed such that I can sell them on my own platform through my own site at my prices. Then I have the option of putting them on udemy or not.

============
Here's some things you need to immediately fix or Udemy won't even accept you:

1) The gain on your mic is up too high and it sounds like an earthquake when you type
2) There's a constant background hiss / noise through out the video, my mic does this too but you need to use screenflow or something else to remove it (I'm sure there's a filter for it)
3) Severe distortion happening at some points in the video, typically occurs when cell phones are near your recording station (I move mine to a different room)

What video would this be used for once you cleaned it up? In my opinion spending a full 5 minutes on yourself is way way way too long for Udemy. People just want to know "is this course for me?" and are super impatient, even now I'm not too happy about some of my intro videos because I spend 30 seconds talking about the success of my previous courses (total video length is ~2 minutes).

Your just enough series reminds me a lot like https://www.learnenough.com/ (something the rails tutorial guy founded). I like the idea of both.

===========
Camtasia and Screenflow both have it. It's called noise reduction. You'll be able to get it to Udemy standards, it's just configuration issues, not a hardware problem (at both the computer and human level).

I do all of my audio processing in real time with http://www.reaper.fm/download.php (it's free for life like sublime), then feed it as direct input to Camtasia (Screenflow would work too) instead of the mic.

The volume of that test recording is also what is considered industry standard levels in terms of volume. It's about 3 decibels below the point where audio tends to clip/tear.

I don't have any fancy headphones (they were $25) but things sound much different between your recording, my recording A and my recording B. Your volume is much lower too.

===========
By the way a quick hack for the earthquake is to fold a shower towel a few times and put your keyboard on that.

Another option is to put the mic and keyboard on different platforms, or get one of those floating boom stands.

This is my set up:

Except I have the yeti mic instead of that old one.

This is awesome, awesome stuff.  Thank you.  I think there are two things that I need to do. Clearly I need to do more research and trial and error on my side so I'm going to do that.  I also think that I'm now starting to understand your concerns about how Udemy gets you no more than $7 per class.  I'm seeing the massive discounts that they deliver.

I'm starting to wonder about this as an at least N fold revenue stream:

* udemy - once I get the multimedia issues ironed out
* ebooks - I can start with like 3 chapters and I have more than that complete
* something recurring revenue - what I really want is a revenue stream that repeats every month.  I've been debating screencasting for a long time.  I'm writing enough about AWS at this point that I could easily do screen casts on AWS and I'm strongly considering it.  I like Josh Adams at elixirsips too much to compete with him but I don't think there's a strong competitor in the aws space and I was able to get awscasts.net which is a decent domain name.  And it leverages what I'm learning in my day job.
* video learning + book content - build video lectures on top of my book content but don't put them on udemy
* consulting - which I've always done

Thoughts?  I really need to finish compiling everything you told me about Udemy into a single document.  That will make it all coalesce into focus.

Hi, 

I think I have a course idea that will force me to learn a few things I need to learn.  I purchased screen flow and I'm about to record the overview lecture.  What video resolution settings have you found work best for Udemy?  Despite the issues, I think the marketing that Udemy has would work well for me.

And just so you know, everything you've told me is getting written down and I'll give it back to you at the end in a formal write up form. I really do appreciate all this.  If the quotes I gave you aren't right for your web site let me know and I'll do them over.


=========
Hi,

Yeah Udemy isn't all terrible. I mean, I am still using them with some regrets, but at the end of the day I get $ from them in a way that I cannot yet generate without them.

I record everything at 1080p, and then Udemy will downscale it as needed for users who aren't able to stream at that quality.

What course are you going to tackle first?

Udemy is very picky with audio too, before going nuts and recording everything, I recommend submitting a test video to them (their backend will tell you how to do this). My BSAWF course almost got denied because there's a very subtle amount of reverb in the audio. This happened because my computer room is wide open with hardwood floors.

I plan on actually blogging about all of this stuff once my new site is up.

Looking forward to reading your responses in the survery, thanks for taking the time to answer them.

===========
Hi, 

I'm not really a video guy.  I was more referring to screen flow offering options like 1280x1024, 1280x960 and so on.

I'll get a test video made.  Good thought.

I'm thinking about a fairly pricey course - something like $150 / course.  My crappy working title is Modern Rails Apps in the Cloud with AWS, MySQL, Redis, Ansible and Inspeqtor   Basically a put rails in the cloud in a modern way overview with all the dev ops stuff thrown in.  Thoughts?

===========
1080p would be 1920x1080 which is fairly standard.

It could work, that's similar to my Scaling Docker on AWS course which uses rails, sidekiq, RDS, elasticache and ECS but no ansible. It sells pretty well.

Just understand that 95% of the time students will buy it for whatever discounts udemy is promoting, a flat $10 or upto 90% off.

===========
Hi, 

Eh.  That's ok.  I have to dip my toes into something if I want to get wet.  I might do some teaser courses first since its a more achieveable goal.

Funny you ask about the process of creating courses. At this point after having done 4 courses (first one wasn't on Udemy), I have came up with a lot of little tips and cheatsheets to save time. I actually planned to release a few blog posts on it and it was going to be a component of a book.

Here's a 2 minute brain dump that's super condensed:

I use camtasia to record all of the videos (would use screen flow if I had a mac), then I use REAPER to enhance the audio in real time. The work flow is I press record on camtasia and it records both video and enhanced audio, then I just record and go. I usually try to record 1 lecture at a time, and will edit out the mess ups.

I assemble the course in the same way you would assemble a book. I outline the sections, etc.. I always make sure all of the source code is 100% fully working and tested multiple times before I start recording. I also script out everything, almost word for word but try to improvise during the presentation when possible (this is something I want to move away from and go from 90% scripts 10% improvision to 90% improvision 10% scripts, it would save A LOT of time... literally weeks).

Latest Flask course is nearly 10 hours of recorded content and has an ebook component for notes. It took about 10 weeks from end to end.



========
That is a long discussion.

Udemy aggressively markets for you, but you lose 50% of the revenue.

You could market yourself through your blog, etc. and you keep 97% revenue of sales as long as you link to your course with a coupon code that you set up.

Problem with that is, if someone goes to your blog, clicks your link for 20% off your course and ends up on Udemy's page and they happen to be running a 30% off sale, then the user will end up buying it for 30% off and Udemy will cannibalize your promotion, so now you end up with 50% of the 30% off price. It's total bs.

============
What that translates to is keeping about $7-8 per sale on average on a $30 product. The reason it's so low is Udemy spam sells your course for a huge discount. Often times they will promote your course for $10 of which you keep $5, so that lowers the average by a lot.

As an instructor you could decide to opt out of those promotions and Udemy will never sell your course at a discount, but you'll be basically invisible on their platform and get no organic sales since you'll be filtered out of search results and never promoted by Udemy.
