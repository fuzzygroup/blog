<p>While I am hugely interested in Podcasting and will soon launch my own podcast on my new domain <a href="http://www.techwarstories.com/"><strong>TechWarStories.com</strong></a> (cue the voice over now; its a podcast*), <a href="http://www.ookles.com/">http://www.ookles.com</a> is NOT a podcasting company.  Keep in mind that I described it as a Web 1.0 company.  Podcasting ain't web 1.0.  Its so damn cool and post modern that it certainly ain't web 1.0.  I mean look at something like <a href="http://soccergirl.podshow.com/">Soccer Girl Incorporated</a> which I don't even know how to describe.  I mean its damn funny and interesting but how do you describe it?<br />
*Well it WILL BE a podcast.  I have the first episode recorded <strong>"Transitive Geek Fu or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Snake"</strong> but its still on my laptop. Coming soon I promise</p>
