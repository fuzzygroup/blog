Despite being a computer scientist by profession, or at least a software engineer, I am not formally trained.  I have a degree in management of all things.  As a result, there are times when I find holes in my education.  I'm a whiz at the applied stuff but, often, the more formal things just pass me by.  Ask me to do fizzbuzz and I can do it but the odds are that I won't even remember what fizz buzz is.  I'm doing a lot more big stuff lately and it feels like I should be recognizing more trends in the data and how it impacts run time.  For this reason I'm going to take a few week dodge from my normal topics and focus on fundamentals.
