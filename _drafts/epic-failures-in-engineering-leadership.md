## The Strange and Curious Case of The 6 Hour Contractor
I'm going to begin by telling a tale on myself.

So would code reviews have helped here?  Actually no.

  - we coulda been cold fusion or php

##Why Engineers Shouldn't Be Allowed to Make Economic Decisions
Java instead of React Native by letting him choose java he effectively doubled your engineering cost base forever more and screwed over an MVP

##The Post MVP Phase: Rewrite or Polish
Rewrite instead of build on top of 

Not calling otu people who failed to get the MVP running on their box; if you don't have the code runing then you don't get a vote because you didn't do your job and evaluate it

Here were the constraints:
* No specifications had been written yet by product management
* 8 week time frame, start to finish, to produce something better than the MVP which itself had taken 7 weeks by one very smart, very fast engineer
* The company's next round of funding depended on producing this; i.e. if they didn't show paying customers by 4 weeks after the launch; there was a very good chance they wouldn't get their next round of funding
