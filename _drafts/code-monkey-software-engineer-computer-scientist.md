So my buddy Nick mentioned to me that he wrote a blog post titled [Are You a Computer Scientist or a Code Monkey?](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/are-you-a-computer-scientist-or-a-code-monkey) and I almost instantly had typed:

  jekyll post "Code Monkey, Software Engineer, Computer Scientist"
  
I don't actually think that he had finished talking before I had my take on this going.  So:

* Go read [Nick's post](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/are-you-a-computer-scientist-or-a-code-monkey); it is good and I'll wait.
* Come back because my take on it is different.

Nick looked at this in terms of are you a code monkey or are you a computer scientist.  Personally I think that this is more nuanced than that.  And I don't think that it is impossible to actually be all of these at once depending on the project.

# Science Versus Engineering

There are a great many people on the Internet who can talk to you about the difference between science and engineering.  To me the fundamental difference is that science is concerned with the **WHY** and engineering is concerned with the **HOW**.  As an example consider a hashing algorithm like MD5.  A computer scientist can explain *why* it works but a software engineer just cares about *how* it works. 

# Code Monkey
# Software Engineer
# Computer Scientist
# An Example

If you look at my recent Poor Man's Load Balancer post, I think this is a nice illustration of shifting between Computer Scientist and Software Engineer.
