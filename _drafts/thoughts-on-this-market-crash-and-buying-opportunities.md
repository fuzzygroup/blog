Here are some buying opportunities.  Use these at your own risk.  I'm an amateur but this is what I see being affected by Covid:

## Things to Buy

* Work from Home is going to be large.  Tooling for work from home is going to be needed.  The best tool for Team communications is Slack Technologies (NYSE: WORK)
* Amazon is going to benefit from this (no one wants to go out) but they will take a supply chain hit likely.
* Grocery Delivery and meal delivery.
* Medical Oxygen is going to get a huge boom in need.  I don't know who the players are here but someone has to be making tanks, filling tanks, making masks and such.
* Funeral Homes.  This is an outside thing since it means a lot of deaths need to happen but body disposal is going to be a problem.
* Supply Chain and moving stuff back to the US.  We're going to see huge [supply chain disruptions](https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-supply-chains-china-46d82a0f-9f52-4229-840a-936822ddef41.html) and that's going to lead to stuff coming back here.  There must be a way to profit from this.
* Airlines.  Air travel is going to be hit hard from this but it will inevitably come back.  And when it does, I suspect the strong players will survive.  And to me that always means SouthWest.

## Things to Avoid

* Restaurants
* Hospitality
* Travel
* Conferences
* Events / Music / Concerts

## The Big Picture

For any investing opportunity look at players with cash on hand.  Companies with cash on hand will be able to weather this better.
