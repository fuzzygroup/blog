If you're reading this then you're almost certainly a developer (or a friend; Hi Dave West) and if so I would urge you to listen to [Software Engineering Daily podcast on CloudBleed](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/03/04/cloudbleed-and-sha-1-collision-with-max-burkhardt/).  Just follow the link and you can listen right from your browser.  You should really do this now whether or not you ever listen to podcasts.  As most developers I fall into the category of "security conscious but not really security knowledgeable" and this podcast does a fantastic job of making clear:

* Exactly what happened
* Whether or not it was a big deal (personally I think its a bigger deal than they acknowledged)
* What passwords you should change (I changed my Medium and Uber passwords)
* Explaining the issues with SHA1

I'd also like to absolutely commend Jeff from SE Daily for not doing this interview himself.  While I really, really enjoy Jeff's style, security is hard
