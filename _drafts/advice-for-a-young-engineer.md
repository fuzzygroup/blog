title: Advice for a Young Engineer
---

I've got a new hire coming for the first time in a long while so I thought it was time to put on by gray beard and pontificate for a while.  Here goes:

1.  Learn your boss' technical weaknesses.  
2.  There's a reason for everything.
3.  Don't re-invent the world.
4.  Refactor Wisely
4.  Gems are dangerous.
5.  Codebases are living things.
6.  Pair Program Regularly
7. Monitor Everything
8. Code reviews are a myth
9.  Never release major changes on a thursday or friday.
10.  Never work more than 40 hours per week.
11.  You likely aren't as smart as you think you are.

Each is discussed more below.

    if 3 == 4
    else
    end

## Don't Re-invent the World
## Refactor Wisely
## Gems are Dangerous
## Codebases Are Living Things
## Pair Program Regularly
## Monitor Everything
## Code Reviews are a Myth

## Never Release Major Changes on a Thursday or Friday
## Never Work More than 40 Hours Per Week
## You're Likely Not as Smart as You Think You Are
I am a smart guy.  And I'm absolutely not as smart as I think I am.  I would wager that that is true for yourself.
