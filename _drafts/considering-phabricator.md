So I ran across [phabricator](https://phacility.com/phabricator/) from [phacility](https://phacility.com) recently and I'm intrigued.  I also had a horrific out of the box experience trying it out that I thought nicely illustrated a number of what I consider straight up fails.

Phabricator is a multi author code review and management tool that was originally built at Facebook and is now a hosted open source product.  They describe it as: *Discuss. Plan. Code. Review. Test. - Every application your project needs, all in one tool.* and I think that's a fairly solid overview.  They also have a hell of a great sense of humor and if you haven't read this [page](https://phacility.com/phabricator/) then you should go there now and search for either intern or purple.  +10 for the sense of humor.

So I went to phacility and chose to set up a hosted instance in order to evaluate it.  Here's my sad, short, less than sweet experience:
