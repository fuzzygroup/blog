I don't do a lot of fancy presentations.  About the fanciest thing I do is a slide with:

* Title
* A bunch of bullets
* that come in one by one also known as a "build"

Years and years ago when I used PowerPoint this was trivial but I found that Apple's Keynote made it surprisingly hidden.  Here's the secret trick:

1.  Go to a slide where you want bullets to appear one by one.
2.  Select the text box where the bullets are (if there are multiple text boxes then you need to do this on each of them).
3.  Bring up the Inspector with Command + Option + I.  
4.  On the Build in tab, select Add an Effect.
5.  From the list choose Appear.
6.  On the Delivery drop down, select By Bullet.

Alas this needs to be done on **every** slide.
