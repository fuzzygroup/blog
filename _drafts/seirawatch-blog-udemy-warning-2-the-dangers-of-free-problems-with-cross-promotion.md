wow this is fucked, i can't promote the let's encrypt course to my free dive into docker course on udemy
in other words, it's useless to have that on udemy
what can't you?
Why can;t you?
Nick Janetakis (nick.janetakis@gmail.com)
it's not "eligible" because it's free
sheesh
Nick Janetakis (nick.janetakis@gmail.com)
this is a huge unexpected bullshit thing
it means i can't market any paid content to any of those people

Contact Udemy ? 
how many thousands of people are free ?
Nick Janetakis (nick.janetakis@gmail.com)
almost 7,000 -- it's like a third of my audience
Wow.  That completely ruins having free content on udemy
Nick Janetakis (nick.janetakis@gmail.com)
yep
can you promote free to free ?
Nick Janetakis (nick.janetakis@gmail.com)
nope, because you're not allowed to promote anything outside of udemy
there's announcements and promotions
promotions are paid content for existing students (only paid i guess)
if you made a free ssl intro course could you promote that to your free udemy people ? 
Nick Janetakis (nick.janetakis@gmail.com)
announcements are meant for like blog posts and other updates, not advertising courses
no idea, all i know is i'm sick now
as soon as i send this promo out
i'm removing dive into docker on udemy
anything I can do ?
Now
