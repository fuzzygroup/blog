<p>Man Scott Johnson would never leave Feedster.  Oh that's right.  He did.  Hm... Next thing you'll tell me that he's using a mac.  Oh crap.  He switched (mostly).  Next thing you'd tell me is that he'd actually consider working for Microsoft...</p>
<p>Would I work for Microsoft?</p>
<p>Well I now use a Mac regularly so clearly anything can happen.  Given <a href="http://fuzzyblog.wordpress.com/wp-admin/scobleizer.wordpress.com/2005/12/18/bill-we-should-hire-scott/">Robert's post the other day</a> and my notable Open Source leanings, you're probably thinking "Scott would never join Microsoft".  Well that's an open question actually.  Bear in mind that I've got a wife and son to think about.  That means as much as I'm a hard core startup guy, I owe it to them to follow through on interviews.  Keep in mind that I'm not independently wealthy and I have no funding for Ookles at present.  And I might not get any.  I'm a bit of a divisive figure on which people are often bipolar.  That often has negative implications. So of course I'd talk to Microsoft.  Not talking to them would be irreponsible and Mother Johnson raised a responsible (to a fault) son.</p>
<p>But, honestly, I have to give credit to my willingness to interview to folks like Scoble, a random Microsoft employee named AnonymousFoo (unclear if he wants to be explicitly named) who emailed me in response to the Scoble piece and we corresponded about stuff.  He's in the vista hardware group and I asked him about my excellent experience with hardware and Ubuntu and he not only understood but had actually installed Ubuntu himself.  The power of a real person reaching out to me like that is just so astonishing.</p>
<p>Clarifying My Open Source Leanings</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind and for me to put out into the public once again is that I'm not a free as in speech guy.  I'm a "likes open source because it leads to better engineering practices" guy.  I used to sell software for a living and bought this house:</p>

<p>with the $$$ from that.  So I</p>
