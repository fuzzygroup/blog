I have spent the past week handing off about 450,00 lines of ruby / ansible code (as measured by rake stats) that are an interface to about 6 terabytes of MySQL data handled by n AWS instances where n varies between 15 and several hundred to a single developer -- who happened to be more junior I was.  He's not a bad guy by any means but, at times, it felt like I had hit him with an intellectual anvil.  We had one week for the transition and, well, this wasn't a one week thing.  Honestly one month wouldn't have been enough.   

 Towards the end of the hand off, this developer pulled me aside and indicated his concerns and I can understand this.  So I thought I'd write out some recommendations for *Leveling Up as a Developer*.
 
 # Its All About Immersion
 
 About 6 months ago, I realized that the future of computing lay, imho, in AWS.  After having resisted cloud hosting for years, I finally buckled down and immersed myself in it. 
 
 # You Need a Side Project
 
 I think every single developer out to have a side project.  It doesn't have to be grandoise in nature but your day job doesn't always allow you to learn the things that you need.  And a side project should let you do whatever you need 
 
 # You Need to Write Code Every Single Day
 
 # You Need to Write It Down

 # Realize This Basic Fact
 
 I've now been working in software development since '87 and it took me years and years to learn this basic fact: 
 
 > Any software engineer increases their skills in direct proportion to the **number** of different codebases that they work on.
 
 The problem here is that when you're an employee the number of different codebases you're generally exposed to is, well, **one**.  The single best thing I ever did for my engineering skills was to move to being a freelancer.  I can cite which experience, since 2010, the start of my freelancing, taught me what:
 
 * AppData - Large scale data *everything*
 * HowAboutWe - ActiveRecord optimization
 * StreamSend - Alternative ActiveRecord sharding architecures for decreasing hosting costs
 * LiveText - How to take a code base without any tests and grandfather them in without breaking things
 * FI Navigator - Devops
 * Interana - SAML
 * SigStr - MongoDB i.e. the world is not entirely MySQL
 * AddApp - Primary market research and ideation
 * Inside Network - How to write a billing system end to end that scales to millions of dollars and operates with zero downtime over a multiyear period
 * MDDX - Complex mathemetical workflows in Ruby
 * LinkedIn - Low level optimizations for an intensive Ruby workload
 * Trazzler - Geopositioning
 
 Had I been stuck in 1 or even maybe 3 different jobs since 2010, I'm absolutely certain that I would never have picked up all these things.
