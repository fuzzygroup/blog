On a short term basis my rate is $200 per hour.  If you'd like to negotiate an ongoing arrangement that can be done and that can pretty dramatically affect the rate.

Here's what I bring to the table

What can I do for you?


Who the Heck Are You?

At heart I'm a software engineer.  Nothing makes me happier than solving complex problems with code.  But I can also qualify as senior technical staff for an organization.  

What Have You Built

Over the years I've built a lot of shipping products including:

* The HyperWriter family of authoring tools - HyperWriter, HyperWriter for Training, HyperWriter Professional, HyperAwk
* The Doctor Dobbs Journal on CD-ROM 
* eduFire - An online marketplace for freelance educators and students to discover each other and run for pay video learning sessions using the Adobe Connect platform (Rails)
* The Feedster blog search platform
* AppData - 

And that doesn't count the different products I've consulted on from time to time.  That's just the full stack systems I've been primarily responsible for developing.
