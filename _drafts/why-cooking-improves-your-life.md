# Cooking Improves Your Quality of Life

If I was to think about the things I've done that have actually improved my life, it would be a short list:

* Meeting my wife changed my life so massively I can't describe it.
* Having kids was a revelation in a positive sense.
* Learning to program fundamentally changed my life for the better.  
* Seriously learning to cook?  Its right up there.

I will eat 2 to 3 times per day until the day I did.  On annual basis that's between 700 to 1,000 meals per year.  I don't eat out anymore and I don't eat processed, pre-prepared anything which means that almost everything I eat is healthier for me, lower calorie and I actually know what's in there.  Yes it is more work and I'll grant you that but
