title: The Bullshite of Engineers Learning on their Own Time
---
One of the Silicon Valley myths that I really, really dislike is this:

> Aren't good engineers keeping up with technology on their own?

That's a direct quote from a good friend of mine who is married to a practicing software engineer.  My response was pretty simple and direct:

> That's actually extremely rare.  That's a myth the industry likes because it reduces job training costs.  For example, if you are a civil engineer, no one expects you to pour concrete on your own time.  And yet all types of people seem to expect software engineers to be constantly programming on their own.  Sigh.



It makes sense that when you're looking at years since graduation you're trading experience against relevant education...



Example - if you are a construction engineer, no one expects you to pour concrete on your own time
