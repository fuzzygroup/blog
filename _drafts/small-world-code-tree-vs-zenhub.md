My father, a small businessman his whole life, has always commented to me on how the small nature of any industry.  And he has always cautioned me to maintain an outstanding personal reputation for integrity because of that.  As I'm traveling down to ElixirCon and in line to buy a burrito, I see a notification on my phone "Kareem Mayan published ... " in the Medium app.  Wow.  It is a small world.  

At the late, lamented eduFire, Kareem was the co-founder and one of two guys who hired me.  Because of him I dove ever more deeply into Ruby and took on Rails back in the pre 1.0 days.  He didn't even balk, when on my second week on the job I came down with Pneumonia in the summer and spent a week incommunicado.  That was also the week that I finished all the Harry Potter books but thanks to the fever, I was still surprised in the last movie.  Quite literally he changed my life for the better.  He also strongly encouraged our move from subversion to git which was hugely important.  Understanding version control is one of those seminal skills for a software developer and git made me better at it than I ever was with subversion.

**Sidebar:** Say what you will about Ruby / Rails but I've been employed more than full time since 2007 due to Ruby / Rails and the $$$ I make from it have been transformative.  It has also leveled up my skills dramatically.  

Anyway I'm back in the market for real development tools with a new hire coming on board at my day job and what is Kareem doing?  Well he's one of the people behind CodeTree which competes with the other tool I'm looking at, ZenHub.  So it really is a small world - I haven't thought about Kareem in probably 7 years now and all I knew was he went full "Digital Nomad" for quite a while.  And now he's providing an interesting tool.

** To the Comparison

Here are some thoughts:

* **marketing materials**.  CodeTree's site looks awful on an iPhone.  That impacts nothing on the tool itself but when you're considering tooling and looking the site on an iPhone, well, appearance counts.
* **browser support**.  ZenHub is tied heavily to Chrome as a browser.  That concerns me a lot because I use a bunch of different machines, iPad and such.  CodeTree doesn't seem to have such limitations.
* **pricing**.
