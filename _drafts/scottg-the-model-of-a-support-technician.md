I don't think I'm wrong in saying that working in technical support is a lot like working in plumbing.  Now bear in mind that I'm not saying that in an insulting fashion by any means.  Specifically:

1.  Disclaimer:  I grew up working in a hardware store.  My first "technical training" was selling to people like plumbers and electricians.  I have tremendous respect for plumbers.  Also in the class of random skills, I'm a certified outboard motor technician.  Suffice it to say that I'm a believer in getting your hands dirty.  Finally I'm fairly certain that the plumber I use makes more money than I do.  Also I've run the help desk before and I've been a support technician myself (Level 1 and Level 2).
2.  Both professions are about getting you hands dirty and mucking about.
3.  Both professions require you to be hands on, thorough and detailed.

If you're a bad plumber then well pipes burst and things leak and you have unhappy customers.  Similarly if you are a bad support technician then problems don't get solved and you have unhappy customers.  If you are a good plumber then you'll have happy customers forever.  Similarly if you are a good support technician then you'll have happy customers.  I am a happy customer.  In fact I'm so happy that I'm writing a whole blog post about a recent support encounter and the fantastic support I got from a technician named ScottG at a company called [MindTouch](http://www.mindtouch.com/).

# ScottG - An Excellent Support Technican

So the situation was that I was working with SAML which is a notoriously finicky technology.  Just to give you an idea how finicky there are 8.1 million hits on Google for [H.264 video compression algorithm](https://www.google.com/search?q=h.264+video+compression+algorithm&oq=h.26&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j5j0l3.2887j0j3&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) and there are 4.6 million hits on Google for [SAML](https://www.google.com/search?q=h.264+video+compression+algorithm&oq=h.26&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j5j0l3.2887j0j3&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#q=saml).  SAML is a hard thing but it shouldn't be half as hard as decompressing video but that's how many problems people have with SAML.
