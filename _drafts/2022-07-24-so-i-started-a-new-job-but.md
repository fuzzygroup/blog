I got this set of instant messages from an engineer who used to work for / with me.  Although it really wasn't a formal reporting relationship, there was a clear mentoring aspect and part of the reason for there NOT being a reporting relationship was:

* His seniority
* My being a contractor not a full time employee (and he was a full time employee)

Here are his messages

**Me**: How is the new job continuing ?

**Him**: All things considered, it's going pretty well! Already got my first paycheck, so at least I know that's in working order, and I've been doing mostly supplemental work and presentations. My team is very small right now: just myself, my manager, and one other more junior data scientist who joined less than a month before me. We'll have two more team members by mid-August though.

**Him**: The biggest issues I've seen so far is a lack of punctuality or good meeting etiquette, I'd say. There doesn't seem to be much encouragement to end meetings on time or arrive at them in a timely fashion. It also isn't clear why the more junior guy I mentioned seems to be doing more of the project management items - from what I can tell, he's spread very thin on a lot of different communications. In addition, my manager isn't very assertive about getting administrative items pushed through and not always clear what the priority is. I think all of these issues are something I need to find out how to raise with my manager, but we don't even have regular 1:1s set up yet. Would appreciate any questions or perspective you have on that.

**Me**: That mostly sounds good.  I'm going to think about your issues and put something down in writing.  That sound good? Do these people report to you? or are you their peer?

**Him**: I haven't been informed that anyone reports directly to me as of yet, but the job description I accepted said my position will have direct reports at some point. In conversation, the junior guy is described as a data scientist, by himself and our team lead, while his profile in the employee directory lists him as a contingent worker. So far I've treated them as a peer and had good interactions with them, though my understanding is my position is more senior than theirs. And yeah, there's no rush, please feel free to think on it as much or as little as you like.

**Him**: Also happy voice call if that'd be preferable
