title: Startup Coach xx Sand The Underside of the Drawers
---
yeah, there was a great quote i read recently about that topic in general
sand the underside of the drawers , from a lead guy over at Pixar (the movie company)
the gist of it is, if you spend the time polishing things that most people don't even notice, imagine how good the visible aspects of the product is
and i think people do notice little things like "wow, this button alignment is off just a little bit" and then they associate that to a negative feeling about the site
