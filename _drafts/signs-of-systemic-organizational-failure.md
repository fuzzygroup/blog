title: Signs of Systemic Organizational Failure

[8:26 AM, 12/5/2016] Scott Johnson: rant for later today “We just have to be creative and figure out how to get more done — we’re behind every week"                        
[8:27 AM, 12/5/2016] Wife: Wow.                        
[8:28 AM, 12/5/2016] Scott Johnson: Because the way to make someone that regularly works more than 40 hours per week work harder is to diminish their efforts.  How about accepting that — AS YOU’VE BEEN TOLD — that you are under staffed and your problem is bigger than you initially understood.                        
[8:28 AM, 12/5/2016] Scott Johnson: m o r o n s                        
[8:28 AM, 12/5/2016] Wife: Seriously!                        
[8:29 AM, 12/5/2016] Wife: What the hell do they expect from you?! Sheesh.                        
[8:30 AM, 12/5/2016] Scott Johnson: Honestly they will never, ever be happy.  This is the kind of job where I could work 100 + hours per week and there’s still no way to succeed.  It is why I’m always so frustrated                        
[8:30 AM, 12/5/2016] Scott Johnson: in reviewing the week’s work I had more than 10 top level “current” projects                        
[8:30 AM, 12/5/2016] Scott Johnson: and no one other than me sees the flaw in that.                        
[8:30 AM, 12/5/2016] Wife: They are not very smart                        
[8:31 AM, 12/5/2016] Scott Johnson: Good at their domain but they know nothing about software engineering and they are too arrogant to ask
