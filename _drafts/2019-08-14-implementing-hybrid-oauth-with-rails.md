If you've been a software engineer long enough you will find that there are technology standards that you just find abhorrent.  For me this is callback style authorization flows, specifically oauth.  I learned to hate this about a decade ago when I was the lead developer on AppData, a Facebook app indexer and, well, the visceral and instinctual loathing that it inspires has never left me.  

And, naturally, when you hate something, it seems to land in your lap.  I'm currently implementing a hybrid oauth flow and I found the process tricky enough that I wanted to document it well -- hence this post.  A hat tip to my co-worker Sean Kennedy who came up with an inspired approach to dealing with URI fragments.
