**July 3, 2022** -- That's a day that will forever be etched into my brain.  That is the day that I let my family down and today I thunder to the heavens:

# Never Again!

And, with a dramatic flourish and my fist shaking at the sky, let me explain ...

1.  I'm the Dad in the house and I have my role in our family -- I make the food and I keep the (literal) machinery running.
2. We had just gotten home from a 20+ hour road trip -- returning to Indiana from Maine and it was about to be the Fourth of July!
3. Every July 4, we celebrate with our kids and our pool and this is what I found when I opened the pool on July 3rd:

4. Yep.  That's a giant puddle of cloudy, smelly, toxic water that is pretending to be the pool that was just serviced two days earlier by a leading Indianapolis pool company aka "pool ruining" idiots.
5. And that's how I spent my Fourth of July -- telling my family that we weren't having that pool party and I got be plumber from July 3rd to today July 13th when our pool became swimmable.

Never Again!!!
