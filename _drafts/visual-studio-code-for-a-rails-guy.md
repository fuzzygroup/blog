Editors are among the stickiest of software tools for a developer.  Want to get me to change editors -- good luck!  I've been using TextMate since 2006 now and only switched off the long obsolete TextMate 1 to TextMate 2 about a year ago.  Editors are just that sticky.  Here are some of the things I've tried and rejected since the point I realized that I'm stuck in legacy land:

* Sublime (didn't feel right)
* Atom (too slow)
* VIM (been there; done that; got the t-shirt; ;wore the t-shirt until it was threadbare; wrote several hundred k lines of code in it from 2002 to 2005; no thanks; only server side from now on)
* MacVIM (didn't feel right)

Again and again I walk away from TextMate but I keep coming back.  However, recently, Nick has convinced me to try Visual Studio Code and I'm **intrigued**.  As someone who literally came of computing age with Borland and Microsoft IDEs, I never expected myself to once again be in a Microsoft produced editor and I would have bet money that that editor would NOT run on Linux -- I would be wrong, 1000% wrong.  Visual Studio Code: 

* Feels Great
* Runs on Linux
* Performs Pretty Well
* Has An Enormous Plugin Library
