title: How to Provide Great Technical Support
---
Dave Bortone knew this

Doing technical support is not a complicated thing.  Even doing technical support well is not complicated.  At its core technical support amounts to:

1. Listen to the customer's needs.
2. Help the customer with their problem.
3. Be accessible.
3. Don't be a jerk
4. Don't make the customer feel stupid.
5. Admit when you get it wrong.  When you support a complex product then, inevitably, you will get it wrong at some point.
6. Have examples and things in writing to give to the customer when they really need it.

During the course of the Interania project, Neal and I had the experience of interacting directly with both Lithium and MindTouch support and despite both companies supporting the same thing, SAML access to their product, the experiences could not have been more different:

* Our experience with MindTouch was so overwhelmingly positive that I emailed our support technician's boss and the subject line was "You Have an Outstanding Staffer in ScottG".
* In all my years in this industry, I have never had a more frustrating experience with support than Lithium.  After about half the interactions with Lithium, I'd get off the phone and curse a blue streak and be angry for about an hour or more.

# Interacting with Lithium

We had two points of contact with Lithium:

* Colleen
* Vicky

Colleen was the overall project manager and I'm going to leave the discussion of Colleen's issues to Neal.  Suffice it to say that I am not a fan of hers.

Vicky was our technical contact and I believe his role was as implementation manager or technical expert.  Here are the problems that we experienced with Vicky:

* **No Adhoc Accessibility**.  Every single interaction with Vicky had to be scheduled and planned in advance.  He simply wasn't someone would could be called for support.  Often times this would mean that we couldn't interact with him for more than a day which makes debugging a complex system hard.
* **Don't be a Jerk**.  At different points in my career I've had direct responsibility for managing customer support including hiring and training support technicians.  One of the thing things I always used to emphasize to them is that this is a customer service position and while you know more than the customer with respect to our product, you don't actually know more than the customer in general.  In general I used to sum up how to interact with customer as "Don't be a Jerk".  This is not a lesson that anyone ever taught Vicky because now, even more than a month after I last interacted with him, I'm still angry at him (and Lithium).  
* **Don't Make the Customer Feel Stupid**.  Going right along with don't be a jerk is don't make the customer feel stupid and this is one that Vicky violated with in spades.  Given that a support technician always knows more about the product then the customer, it is very easy for a support technician to act superior and Vicky certainly did that.  Having looked up Vicky's credentials on LinkedIn, I can certainly attest to Vicky being a smart guy but there's no need to bolster your own ego by making someone else feel like crap when they make a mistake.
* **He Never Admitted When He Got It Wrong**. I am always the first person to admit when I get something wrong and there were times in this project when I did get things wrong.  This was a complex project and we had two vendors with the opposite approach to the same technology which always leads to problems.  Now in the course of interacting with Vicky when I got something wrong I handled it correctly and a) apologies and b) admitted it.  Now, if I had been the only person who got things completely wrong, that would have been fine but Vicky was also absolutely technically wrong on at least 2 if not three occasions.  These were cases where he told me to do X and it was entirely unambiguous.  On these occasions where he got it wrong thus wasting both my time, Neal's time and the time that we were paying them for support, he failed to ever admit it, take responsibility for it or apologize.  Even when I specifically called him out on this he would just brush it aside and fail to address it.  I understand that no one wants to be wrong but when you are then *own it* and *learn from it*.  Vicky did not and would not.
* **Nothing in Writing**.  One of the things that I think affected our entire Lithium SSO implementation was that there wasn't anything in writing after the initial presentation that Colleen gave us (and she did do a good job on that).  For example once we were ready to go live it was very unclear how that happened so I specifically asked Vicky for something in writing to guide us through the process.  It didn't have to be much -- even an email that enumerated the steps would have been fine.  Nothing was ever forth coming.  I suspect that Lithium themselves actually do not have a lot of SSO experience and this cannot really write this down in a cohesive fashion.  There were a number of very complex aspects to our integration that should have been clearly documented that were not.  Things like how data ownership works when you use SSO had to be figured out by trial and error.  

# Conclusion

Working with Lithium was enormously frustrating and much of the blame goes straight back to Vicky.  He is technically very smart but he lacks the people skills that make working with a customer an experience where the customer doesn't want to reach through the screen and throttle him. Overall Lithium needs to put a lot of work into the customer service portion of their business.
