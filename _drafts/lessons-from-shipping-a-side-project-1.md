Lessons from shipping a side project

1.  Time Bound Yourself on EVERYTHING non Engineering

2.  Don't Try for Perfection

3.  Limit the time to no more than two months no matter what the problem

Honeslty the thing that kept me going from Day 1 was the sole fact that I had constant feedback from what I viewed as a significant real world use

4.  Don't be surprised if the product you end up with bears little to no relationship to the problem you started to solve

5. Get yourself an accountability partner -- 5:01 pm - "Message XYZ with SeiraWatch Status"
