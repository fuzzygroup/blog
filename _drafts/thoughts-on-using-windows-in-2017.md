title: Thoughts on Using Windows in 2017
---


I use Windows daily in my job. It has come a long way from the consumer/business driven PITA it was years ago. The issues are pretty simple: I don't trust Microsoft to not screw me over a few years down the line, and I don't like the in your face consumerism of every aspect of the OS.
I literally had to spend an hour removing every POS adware app installed by the OEM, then I still have to put up with notices from M$ asking me to buy their stuff, even though I don't use their software for anything. And there's the virus software, which are all installed by two or three different people and all of which are asking me everyday to buy their stuff.
It's nice that they've moved devs out of the ghetto and I admire the work people have put in to make sure we have nice things again. But I still will be at best lukewarm to anything from M$.
