I [recently](https://fuzzyblog.io/blog/rust/2022/07/08/rust-alternatives-to-textmate-2-the-agony-of-despair.html) made the allegation that programs written in Rust:

> Result in higher quality software.[July 8th](https://fuzzyblog.io/blog/rust/2022/07/08/rust-alternatives-to-textmate-2-the-agony-of-despair.html)

My argument was that Rust is designed to eliminate a whole class of software errors and that choice would result in higher quality software.  My article appeared on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32034893#32036250) where a number of people took pot shots at it, etc but I do stand by my allegation.  I've now used an admittedly small sampling of Rust software on a daily basis and what exists I do find to be higher quality.  Additionally software engineers I deeply respect like [Bryan Cantrill](https://twitter.com/bcantrill), author of DTrace and co-founder of Oxide have bought into Rust fully.

## The Software Quality Crisis

In my original article, I argued that we currently have a software quality crisis and I stand by that argument.  We are now all heavily reliant on our digital devices.  Every time we crash, we lose time and productivity.  Let's say that we suffer an application or operating system crash one time every two weeks and it costs us just 10 minutes of productivity.  Here's the math on that:

* 26 Crashes
* 10 minutes of time
* 260 minutes a year (26 * 10)
* Time to reset your brain and get back into work - let's say 15 minutes - (26 * 15) -  390
* 260 + 390 or 650 minutes or **10.83 hours per year** you lose due to software crashes

Now, I'm a software engineer and what I do is deeply focused work.  When I exist in a flow state, I'm deeply more productive but getting into a flow state is hard and even harder to get back into it when a software crash rips me out by the roots.

I don't know about you but I am deeply, deeply offended by poor software quality taking away one work day a year -- and I suspect that I'm very much low balling these numbers.
