title: Some Rules for Rust Variables and Data Types
category: rust

I'm puzzling through different aspects of variables and data types in Rust based on [Chapter 3](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html) of the Rust book.  Here, in no specific order, are things that I currently understand to be true:

## Assignment of an Immutable Variable

```rust
let x = 15;
```

## Assignment of a Mutable Variable

```rust
let mut x = 15;
```

## Assignment of an Explicitly Typed Variable

```rust
let f: bool = false;
```

## Assignment of a Char Literal Variable

Note: that char literals are specified with single quotes, as opposed to string literals, which use double quotes.)

```rust
let c = 'z';
```

## Assignment of an Array Variable and Accessing Elements

```rust
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let first = a[0];
let second = a[1];
```

## Assignment of an Immutable Variable

```rust
```

## Assignment of an Immutable Variable

```rust
