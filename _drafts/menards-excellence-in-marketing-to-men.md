Menards is one of those retail things that I had no idea existed until I moved to Indiana.  Imagine a home improvement store that:

* is bigger than Home Depot
* is cleaner and more attractive than Home Depot
* has better lumber than either Home Depot or Lowes
* sells more tools that Home Depot or Lowes combined
* doesn't force you to check out your own stuff like Home Depot
* has staff that is more pleasant, helpful and smarter than Home Depot
* has all kinds of crazy stuff including food, candy, coffee and board games

Well -- that's Menards.  The best analogy I can come up with is Menard does for DIY what Fry's does for computer / entertainment stuff.  It is just that good a place.  I now aggressively try to avoid either Lowes or Home Depot in favor of Menards at all opportunities.
