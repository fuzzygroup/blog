I remember a time, years ago, when someone asked me why engineers are loyal to me.  The incident that inspired this was:

* one of my engineers coming to me with what they felt was a pretty serious organizational slight to me 
* this happened when I wasn't around 
* this engineer could have gotten in a whole bunch of trouble for bringing this to my attention

The person who told this to me was actually quite curious about why someone was that loyal to me and I found that puzzling but let's tease that apart because it is instructive in terms of engineering leadership principles:

1. I speak the language.  Humans are inherently tribal and engineers, more than any other class of humans, are my damn tribe.  I've been working with engineers, on a daily basis, since I was 19 years old.  I'm 52 now.  If you spend that long learning how anything operates you learn to speak the language.
2. I still code.  This week I wrote code for some insane number of hours, the last bit of which involved a 3 day stint of close to non stop coding.  As a general rule of thumb, engineers respect people who can do the work -- because, at the end of the day, the code either compiles or it doesn't.  I am in the trenches with my tribe.  I'm not a white board guy; I'm not an architecture astronaut; I'm a damn engineer.
3. I pay attention.  When I work with engineers, I know who they are, I know what they care about, who their spouses are and who their kids are.  Engineers are people and even though they are engineers, they still want to be treated as people.  We are not just code monkeys.
4. I'm honest to a fault.  I don't sugar coat things.  I don't lie and I am always realistic.

M
Whenever I write an email like that I always BCC the person involved because it gives you a checksum on the honesty of your management.
