<p>Oy.  This hasn't happened yet but I just know its going to.  So I'm going to stick my hand up in the air and say:</p>
<blockquote><p>Oooh!  Oooh!  Oooh!  Mr. Kotter!  Mr. Kotter!  I need some legal advice please.</p></blockquote>
<p>So here's the situation:</p>
<ol>
<li>There are two basically standard provisions when you leave a company and you're a founder: Non disparagement and Non solicitation.</li>
<li>Non disparagement means basically "don't talk trash about your former company".</li>
<li>Non solicitation means "don't steal employees from your former company and (imho) don't encourage them to leave".  Employees in any field are the company's lifeblood and you want to preserve them.</li>
<li>Now a lot of the company's staff at the company I once founded are members of Linked In or Tribe or Ryze and I'm dreading this type of request "Can you please put a recommendation for me on {TrendySocialNetworkingSiteHere}".</li>
</ol>
<p>So what do I do?  I don't want to be difficult and I've always given glowing references to people when they deserve it but how do I do this without possibly stepping on my previously existing employee agreement with the place I founded ?  Can I legally even post a link to a scanned copy of my employee agreement and confidentiality agreement ?  I'm not an attorney and I never played on TV* and since I'm no longer a rogue hacker hanging out in a living room without a wife or son I need to be far more strategic about my actions than I once was**.</p>
<p>Note: On this one credentials matter so if you leave an opinion in the comments and you are an attorney*** please say so.</p>
<p>Yes I know all too well that free legal advice is worth what you pay for it but all of my disposable cash these days goes into toys for him:</p>

<p>A man, after all, must have his priorities.</p>
<p>*Though I've certainly had my share of exposure to legal matters.<br />
**Ah to be young again.  Sigh.<br />
***Or if you play one on TV</p>
