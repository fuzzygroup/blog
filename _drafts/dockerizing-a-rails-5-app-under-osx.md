This blog post lays out the step by step process for Dockerizing a Rails 5 app.  Special thanks goes out to my Docker Instructor, Nick Janetakis.  I took his Docker course and I literally could not have done this without his course.

# Step 1: Create a Dockerfile

# Step 2: Create a docker-compose.yml file 

# Step 3: Create a .env file

# Step 4: Update config/database.yml

# Step 5: Update database.yml 

# Step 6: Run docker-compose up --build
