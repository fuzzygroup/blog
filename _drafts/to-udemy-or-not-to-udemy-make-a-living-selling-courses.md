Scott's Rule of Udemy or Not

The more detailed and specific the course, the smaller the market and the greater the price has to be.  The more general the course, the greater the market and the lower the price.  Udemy works for mass market, low price, high volume courses.

As an example, a Docker course about the Moby open source components could have a price as high as a $100 or $200 but since Udemy would discount it severely, it needs to be sold via a direct model.  Where as an Intro to HTML course might have a price of $25 but be discounted down to $15 and you get $7.
