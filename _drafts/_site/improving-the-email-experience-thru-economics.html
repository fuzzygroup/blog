<p>I recently had one of those frustrating experiences where I wrote an email and failed to get a reply.  I hate that because 99 % of the time its actually ok but that 1% of the time you’d really like your mail system to alert you to it.  Once upon a time my NTERGAID co-founder, Brian, and I wrote an Outlook plugin called Inbox Buddy which enhanced your inbox by dealing spam, color coded your messages by relationship type and so on.  This was in 2002 or so and we never made any traction on it mostly because we (well me) foolishly insisted on supporting the installed base of Outlook users instead of the coming base (the next rev of Office).  Because the API we were working with was so limited we never really got traction and then Feedster exploded in popularity and I lost track of it.  I regret that.  Great name.  Great product.  Fantastic partner.</p>

<p>Anyway this is one of those ideas that I had always wanted us to get in there but never did.  A simple bit of data science that can really improve your applications is to add an economic perspective to things.  So, for example, an email you write has a value.  That value can be in proportion to its length perspective.</p>
