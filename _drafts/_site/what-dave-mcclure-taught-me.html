<p>Feedster was not the first company I raised money for but it was the first time I raised money from true silicon valley investors.  I vividly remember <a href="https://fuzzygroup.github.io/blog/startup/2016/09/02/what-scott-rafer-taught-me.html">Scott Rafer</a> taking me around all the different angel groups, individual investors and Sand Hill Road.  One of those investors was <a href="https://twitter.com/davemcclure">Dave McClure</a> of <a href="http://500.co">500 Startups</a> fame.</p>

<p>Dave was one of our angel investors the the one that I felt personally responsible for.  So, after the awful day that I was let go from Feedster, I remember sitting in my apartment in Indianapolis and having to call Dave around 6 pm on a cold fall night and telling him that I was gone and I couldn’t look out for his investment any longer.  He took the news far better than I expected and wasn’t even angry or disappointed with me much to my surprise.  His actual concern was how I was taking everything.  Looking back at this, I can now see it a little differently:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We were just one of many investments that he had</li>
  <li>The amount wasn’t all that large</li>
  <li>Preserving the relationship with the entrepreneur is more important; they’ll do something else</li>
</ul>

<p>So here’s what Dave McClure taught me:</p>

<p class="center center"><strong>Not everything works out.  And that’s ok.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Relationships matter.  Keep relationships strong no matter what.</strong></p>

<p>Now I don’t think I’ve talked to Dave in years at this point but the truth of it is that I’m still impressed by how well he handled this and I still remember it vividly.  And If anyone ever asked me if they should take Dave on as an investor, I’d answer “Yes; a thousand times yes.”</p>
