<p>While I have been resolutely faithful to MySQL ever since 1999, forces keep conspiring pull me towards Postgres.  And, since its in the context of a training course I chose to pay for out of my own pocket, it is time to suck it up and learn.  Alas.</p>

<p>Here are the basics that I’ve been able to learn so far:</p>

<ul>
  <li>mysql: “show tables<ENTER>" ==&gt; postgres: "\dt <ENTER>"</ENTER></ENTER></li>
  <li>mysql: “mysql -uroot -pPASSWORD database” ==&gt; “psql -Upostgres workshop_dev”</li>
  <li>mysql: “ctrl+c” ==&gt; postgres: “\q”</li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
