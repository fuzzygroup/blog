<p>Sometime this fall, my family and I, will head back to DisneyWorld for the requisite family vacation.  The last time we did a big trip like this I ended up spending the bulk of it in the room as my youngest was sick as a dog.  What we thought was a simple fever turned out to be a vicious case of strep throat.</p>

<p>Luckily one of the maids turned us onto Resort Physicians – an old fashioned, honest to goodness, house call.  A fantastic doctor came to our room, took care of us and managed to save what was left of the vacation.  And, ever since, I’ve kept his business card close since I knew we’d be going back again. Here are the details if you need a great doctor at DisneyWorld in Orlando:</p>
