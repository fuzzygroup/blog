<p>I’ve got a new hire coming for the first time in a long while so I thought it was time to put on by gray beard and pontificate for a while.  Here goes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Learn your boss’ technical weaknesses.</li>
  <li>There’s a reason for everything.</li>
  <li>Don’t re-invent the world.</li>
  <li>Refactor Wisely</li>
  <li>Gems are dangerous.</li>
  <li>Codebases are living things.</li>
  <li>Pair Program Regularly</li>
  <li>Monitor Everything</li>
  <li>Code reviews are a myth</li>
  <li>Never release major changes on a thursday or friday.</li>
  <li>Never work more than 40 hours per week.</li>
  <li>You likely aren’t as smart as you think you are.</li>
</ol>

<p>Each is discussed more below.</p>

## Never Release Major Changes on a Thursday or Friday
## Never Work More than 40 Hours Per Week
## You’re Likely Not as Smart as You Think You Are
