title: Dad - Why Do You Read the Newspaper?
---
My youngest son has taken to asking me questions.  And, since he's my son, I find them infinitely interesting and they make me **think**.  He isn't really cognizant of my blogging at present nor do I find it necessary for him to know.  After all, what I write about, isn't of general interest; I'm nerd folk  Still I like to think that on some far off distant day he finds this on the Internet and knows that Dad actually listened.

I've been a reader of print newspapers all my life but I only got serious about it when I changed my major in college from mechanical engineering to management.  One of my first professors, intro to accounting, said to all of us in class "If you're a serious student of business then you read the Wall Street Journal" and, to this very day, *I read the Wall Street Journal*.  I don't always read every page but I try to at least skim it.  Sometimes it might take me a week or more to get to a back log of papers but I do actually get there.

Now my son looks at me, reading a physical paper, and I suspect he thinks something like this"

* Why?
* They just get thrown out
* You have an iPad
* Behind the times Dad, behind the times
* They're expensive
* It's not customized to what you care about

And in some ways he is definitely right.  The Wall Street Journal is expensive.  And it isn't searchable and, as a physical artifact, it has tons of problems.  But the [broadsheet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadsheet) newspaper format has evolved over literally hundreds of years to its present form.  And I would argue that the broadsheet

* Is the fastest way to come up to speed on an information area that changes constantly (I.e. Daily news)
* Doesn't limit me to **only** information that agrees with me
