title: Adding Twitter Cards to Your Jekyll Blog and Using NGrok
category: jekyll
tags: ["jekyll", "twitter", "ngrok"]

**Disclaimer**: My buddy Nick gave me a hand on this one so head over to his [Nick Janetakis](_drafts/adding-twitter-cards-to-your-jekyll-blog-and-using-ngrok.md.) if you like or check out his [Udemy courses](https://www.udemy.com/user/nick-janetakis/); I actually paid for them and they are great.

If you use Twitter much then you've likely seen the moderately new Twitter Cards.
