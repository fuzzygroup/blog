title: Is the Role of Business to Pay a Living Wage
---


I'm moving this conversation over here, because I'm interested in it but don't want to do it at the pace of IM. :)

I'm not a subscriber, and can't see much of the article you shared. My hunch is it's taking about a restaurant blaming a failure on increased labor costs... Though if point out that restaurants are one of the highest failure rate businesses out there


However, if your fear is that capitalism is at risk, I wonder what the fact that real wages are at a 50 year low compared to buying power... So businesses saying they can't manage with a higher wage are somehow not doing something that businesses managed to do under capitalism for a good while.

Also, in the 80s wages and productivity began to diverge. Certainly Regan-era thinking was that trickle down economics made it reasonable for profits to accrue entirely to the owners and not at all to the workers.

I find trickle down economics ridiculous, and even more ridiculous in a consumer economy. 


Another thing wrong with the "businesses will suffer" approach is it relies entirely on what I call in my head P&L managementâ€¦ Only caring about things that get a line on your P&L. But a lot of the financial benefits of treating workers well don't show up there. Research shows that better wages decreases turnover and absenteeism. When I was working with McDonald's in the 90s I heard more than one successful manager say that raising wages was the first step in turning struggling stores around because of those two factors. When you pay as little as you can get away with, you don't end up with people who stay long enough to get really good-and why should they? But none of the money you spend on turnover, or on crappy quality work, shows up on your P&L. The dude I worked for lost his stores at the end of the day because he insisted over a period of years on being cheap about labor costs.
