I saw something online the other day about a person wanting to start some type of location centric online social network based around an app front end, without raising any funding initially, and my immediate thoughts were:

* Interesting
* Oy vey

The person who had written this had a very interesting concept but wasn't a startup person / wasn't a technologist so I thought I'd write up my thoughts about starting an app business.

Disclaimer: I write this as someone who hasn't ever built an app or app business but I am an extremely solid, working engineer and I did spend a decade writing AppData -- a now defunct SAAS business that indexed the different app stores and sold analytics on them.  So I've got a pretty solid handle on trends and the overall app ecosystem.

## Rule 1: It Isn't About the Technology, It Is About the Marketing

You should understand something important here when I say that your app business isn't about the technology -- 

## Rule 2: There Are 4,000,000 Plus Apps in the App Store

One of the things that most people that either start app businesses or want to start app businesses simply don't understand is that there are 4,000,000 plus apps in the App Store:

> In 2019, the App Store offered 903,489 gaming apps. In contrast, as of that period of time the store had 3.06 million non-gaming apps available. As of June 2017, 180 billion apps had been downloaded from Apple App Store. [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/268251/number-of-apps-in-the-itunes-app-store-since-2008/)

And the numbers are similar for the Google Play app store:

> The number of available apps in the Google Play Store was most recently placed at 2.8 million apps, after surpassing 1 million apps in July 2013. [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/266210/number-of-available-applications-in-the-google-play-store/)

Just think about that for a second -- if there are almost 3 million apps for Android / Google Play phones and 4 million apps in the App Store then:

* How is your app business going to stand out and be discovered?
* 

## Rule 3: Understanding App Development

And now we come to the technology that drives any app business.
