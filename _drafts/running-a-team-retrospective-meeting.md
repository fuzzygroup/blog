I am a member of an 8 person team that is:

* part of a non profit
* distributed all over the country
* trying to get started on a new initiative and find our footing; we are about 1 year old (I've only been here for 2 months)
* just had our first offsite

At the offsite I witnessed a fascinating exercises in doing a retrospective on the past year's work that my boss, Dave Sifry, orchestrated.  This is now my third time consulting for Dave Sifry and he and I have done this before but I never documented it so I wanted to write down how to was done. 

## What is a Retrospective Meeting?

A retrospective is when a team looks back and tries to determine:

* what happened
* 

## Requirements

Here's what you need to do this:

* A shared Google Spreadsheet that breaks things down into XYZ.  Here's the template to use.
* A timer; we used "Visual Timer 2" which was awesome since it had great sounds
