In 2009, 2 weeks before Christmas, with no notice, I and the rest of the eduFire startup were laid off with no notice, no severance and no benefits save, I believe, some small level of legally required COBRA.  My role was VP of Engineering and I held stock options on 10% of the company.  It was a mind-blowing level of **suck** and one that I doubt I'll ever forgive the [founder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonbischke) for -- classless in every single way.  I think it was also the last time I've trusted an organization.  

Now I'm a firm believer that there are good times and there are bad and while 2009 was the heights of suck, it launched me down the path of "make lots and lots of money from consulting" and that's been fantastic for me.  In particular I've become more than a bit of what I refer to as a *rails commando* -- I can drop into a Rails code base and add value from Day 1.  This blog post talks about how I go about that.
