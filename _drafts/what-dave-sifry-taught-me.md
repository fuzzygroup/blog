Grace and Kindness 

In a small industry you grow as a function of the market expanding

When I got fired from Feedster, a company I founded and where I hired every single executive, I was in a state of shock.  I had flown out to San Francisco and I knew that I was being terminated but I had expected to retain my board seat so I could at least influence things.  Little did I know that when a founder is removed from his firm, it happens with extreme prejudice.  So, when I discovered that even that had been stripped from me, well, I was a mess.  Over ten years later I remember wandering the streets of San Francisco in a daze.  And, when I needed office space for a few hours, to process the paperwork associated with all this mess, you know where I ended up?  Yep.  That's right -- I went to see Dave.  He let me use wifi, power and fax so I could get the paperwork handled.  At what was a moment of professional lowness, Dave was the very epitome of grace and kindness.
