title: Heinlein on Writing
---

If you look at the quantity of words that I produce or as I would describe them, the quantity of words I vomit onto the Internet, you might wonder if I put a lot of time into writing.  I actually don't and given that a few people I know are looking to embark on writing projects, well, I thought I'd put together a minor screed on the topic giving my personal views on writing productivity.



# Heinlein on Writing

My favorite set of rules for writing come from [Robert Heinlein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein), a now deceased science fiction author.  His rules were:

1. You must write.
2. You must finish what you write.
3. You must refrain from rewriting, except to editorial order.
4. You must put the work on the market.
5. You must keep the work on the market until it is sold.

These rules were written in an age where you were writing for pay and for a print market so they aren't entirely applicable but there is still some good stuff here.  An interesting counter opinion can be found, curiously, on [Gizmodo](https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-famous-writing-advice-that-could-seriously-mess-up-5666113).

And here is my interpretation of Heinlein's rules for writing adapted to the modern world (with my apologies).  Please note that I'm not focused on payment; I'm focused on getting it out there:

1.  You must write.
2.  You must finish what you write.
3.  You must refrain from **needless** rewriting.
4.  You must put the work on the Internet.
5.  You must keep the work on the Internet.

Point 3 deserves some clarification.  My belief is that Heinlein wanted to encourage writers NOT to never rewrite but to refrain from the excessive rewriting / "polishing" that is all too easy in which to engage.

Point 5 means keeping stuff online even tho you may take crap for it / social pressure against it.
