We all have influences in our lives -- books, movies, music.  For me the seminal influence was the writings of Robert A. Heinlein (RAH).  I've read I think every word he ever commercially produced and while I can cite chapter and verse on his fiction, his rules for writing are absolutely brilliant.  Here's a quick summary:

1. Rule One: You Must Write
2. Rule Two: Finish What You Start
3. Rule Three: You Must Refrain From Rewriting, Except to Editorial Order
4. Rule Four: You Must Put Your Story on the Market
5. Rule Five: You Must Keep it on the Market until it has Sold

Robert Sawyer, a fantastic Canadian Science Fiction writer has a great commentary on this on his [Heinlein's Rules](http://www.sfwriter.com/ow05.htm) blog post.

Right now I am faced with a number of startup opportunities in front of me and trying to shuffle the deck so to speak to choose the right one is damn hard.  It seems like all of them are good ideas but they 

So here goes: my attempt to make Heinlein's rules for startups:

1. Rule One: You Must Create Every Single Day.  <br/>Comment: Even an hour per day adds up quickly.
2. Rule Two: Take it to the MVP Stage.
3. Rule Three: You Must Refrain From Making Needless Changes Except Due to Customer Input.
4. Rule Four: You Must Put It Out There.
5. Rule Five: You Must Keep it Running Until It Makes Revenues; Not Profits; Revenues.
6. Rule Six: You must keep spending to an absolute minimum.<br/> Any smart engineer should now be able to make an MVP without spending a dime.
7. Rule Seven: You must design to keep hosting costs to an absolute minimum.<br/>  As I look at technologies like AWS, ansible, ec2, etc, I see that how you choose to structure your architecture can dramatically impact your costs.
