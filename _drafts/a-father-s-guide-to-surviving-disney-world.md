title: A Father's Guide to Surviving Disney World
---
I'm writing this from Orlando, Florida where we're on our fourth trip to DisneyWorld.  Now I realize that t the true *Disney faithful*, four trips ins't a lot, it feels like enough for me to write this with some degree of authority.  


Fathers guide to surviving Disney world
Early morning start
App Up
No small children
Trip planning is key
Disney is an ecosystem and the amount of info is huge 
Carrying less is happiness
Mid afternoon break is essential

Small world for a cool rest
Managing I want I want I want 
Line management or motion is happiness
Getting your kids to carry your stuff
Hydrate hydrate hydrate
A misting fan is your ally
It's going to cost more than you imagined 
Eat lightly
Dining plan is always too much food
