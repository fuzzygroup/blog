title: A Father's Guide to Surviving Disney World
---
I'm writing this from Orlando, Florida where we're on our fourth trip to [DisneyWorld](http://www.disneyworld.com/).  Now I realize that t the true *Disney faithful*, four trips ins't a lot, it feels like enough for me to write this with some degree of authority.  My wife is one of the true Disney faithful and all of this really comes from her one way or another.So here you go - how to survive DisneyWorld. 

# Abandon All Cost Concerns

I originally titled this section, *It's going to cost more than you imagined* and both titles are accurate.  DisneyWorld which was originally envisioned by Walt Disney as a cost effective family vacation has become a **premier vacation destination** and its pricing reflects that.  The bottom line here is that you are going to spend more than you want and the overall experience will be worth it. I've been there and I've never regretted a dime that we spent at DisneyWorld but, dang, it costs.

# Get an Early Morning Start

So there are two things you need to understand about Orlando: 

* Its hot; the closer it gets to noon, the hotter it gets
* The lines are the shortest first thing in the morning

My wife is a huge fan of *rope drop* or getting into the park literally the moment the rope drops.  That way you can race to the rides you care about and generally get on them without lines, fast passes or any waiting at all.  

Overall an early morning start just makes your Disney experience better.  If you only take one thing away from this article, take that.

# Take the Mid Afternoon Break

Your approach to theme parks may vary but, at least for my family, we find a mid afternoon break to be essential.  When the clock hits one or two, its time to go back to the hotel for air conditioning, the pool or just plain down time.  We go back out around three or four and everyone is refreshed, happy and far less cranky.  Please note that this reduced crankiness includes the author.

# Leverage Small World for a Break

If you're at the Magic Kingdom then one of the best rides, when you're hot and tired, is Small World.  While Small World isn't an exciting ride by any means, it is a wonderfully pleasant experience and it has some wonderful attributes:

* Great air conditioning
* About 9 minutes in length
* Moderately comfortable seating
* Gives a great way to talk to kids about racism and why Walt Disney made the ride in the first place

Every trip we've made to DisneyWorld, except for this one, has featured multiple rides on Small World.  Why not this one?  Alas its closed for renovations.   

Please bear in mind that every Disney park has some ride that's the equivalent of Small World in this regard.  Here are some examples:

* Magic Kingdom - Small World, Hall of Presidents
* Epcot - Spaceship Earth, Three Caballeros
* Hollywood Studios - Muppet*Vision 3D
* Animal Kingdom - Primeval Whirl

# No Small Children

One of the biggest mistakes I see other parents make is bringing small children to Disney World.  Now when I say small, I mean under about 7 years old.  I know the parents think "Disney.  Kids.  Great Pictures.  Cuteness Galore!!!"  And that is true.  But what's also true are diapers, strollers and putting small children into a 90 plus degree temperature environment for hours on end.  And what you see are frustrated parents and kids screaming or crying or both.  We held off going for years until our youngest was over 7 years old and that was a fantastic decision.  

# Trip Planning is Key

  * time of year
  * Disney is an ecosystem and the amount of info is huge 


# App Up!

One of the things that has really surprised me is the quantity of apps that can really make your trip better.  Here are the apps that my wife and I use every single time.  All apps below are listed for iOS but most have equivalents for Google Play

* [My Disney Experience](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/my-disney-experience-walt/id547436543?mt=8)
* [WDW Lines](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/disney-world-lines-from-touringplans.com/id411091283?mt=8) (pricey; read below)
* [Wait Times](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wait-times-for-disney-world/id321601474?mt=8) (not always accurate
* [Magic Guide](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/magic-guide-for-disney-world/id365817457?mt=8)

The WDW Lines app offers in app purchase for its line info on all rides (some are included in the free app) and the price seems a bit steep - $12.99 for a year's worth of data.  And, yes, I balked at this the first few times and then I thought about it -- I*'m spending $thousands on this vacation - another $12.99 isn't going to hurt me*.  And I paid.

# Gear Up!

One of the things that has made my trips more successful is putting together a small **nerd bag of doom** or all the gear that techno dad needs to be successful.  Here's what's in mine:


Explanation: 



# Managing I Want, I Want, I Want

Taking kids to DisneyWorld is a bit like taking an addict into a drug den.  All you're going to hear is "I want", "I want", "I want" and, as a parent, its frustrating as heck.  Here's how my wife and I handle it:

* Say no to everything for the first two days
* Give each kid a gift card with an amount on it on the third day
* Tell them "once its out then you're done and I'm not buying you anything"

The reason for not giving it to them on the first few days is that you want them to understand that you don't buy the first thing you see.  Please note that this lesson is received best if Mom and Dad follow this rule also.  The amount you set will depend on you and your kids.  Personally I wouldn't do less than $30 / kid but it also depends on how many kids you have. If you have 6 kids then, well, ouch!

# Line Management or Motion is Happiness

# Carrying Less is Happiness

I always see people carrying big bags, backpacks, etc and I wonder just what they have in them.  Personally I never carry anything more than an almost empty backpack and even that is sometimes too much.  Right now to get into DisneyWorld you have to go thru:

* ticket check
* bag check 
* metal check 

If you can eliminate one of those by not having a bag at all then its one less step to worry about.  And, as mentioned above, Orlando is hot.  The less you carry the happier you will be.

# Getting Your Kids to Carry The Stuff

Here's what I did this trip to get my kids to carry at least some of my stuff:

# Hydrate, Hydrate, Hydrate

# A Misting Fan is Your Ally

# Eat Lightly or Mastering the Disney 10

My wife and I jokingly refer to the *Disney 10* or the ten pounds that it seems you put on after a week at Disney.  We generally, for convenience, use the dining plan and there is a ton of food provided.  However, lately we've taken to treating the dining plan much like tapas - a few bites or this, a few bites of that; we just don't finish our plates anymore.  It isn't an economic way to do things but you don't end up so full and feeling so fat afterwards.  If you're looking for good information about the economics of the dining plan then the ever superb EasyWDW always has [something good to read](http://www.easywdw.com/easy/blog/figuring-out-if-one-of-the-disney-dining-plans-make-sense-for-your-group/).
