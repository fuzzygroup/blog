I recently recommended Free Code Camp to a good friend who runs a local charity, [Outreach Indiana](http://www.outreachindiana.org) as a way for his charity to offer career training to homeless youth (OutReach provides support to homeless youth).  I first learned about Free Code Camp thru the Software Engineering Daily podcast where the founder, Quincy Larson, was interviewed.  I found the concept pretty intriguing, did some research and sent off a recommendation.  Then, last weekend, I realized that I hadn't done the proper due diligence -- I should actually sign up for it and work through the exercises, so I started down that path ...

Now I've been writing HTML and doing web development since about 1993.  I was even at the very first conference where Tim Berners Lee unveiled the world wide web and I vividly remember the paper he presented.  But, despite having done web development for most of my adult life, I'm really not a front end guy at all -- I'm a back end web developer at heart.  I do HTML / JavaScript / CSS only as necessary.  And, to be really honest, I do it poorly at best.  In fact I have so little aptitude for front end development
