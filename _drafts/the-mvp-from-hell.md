Here's an example of just how bad communications got on this project:
Product Manager [5:20 PM]  
@back_end_engineer_#1 @jon @chrisaddapp hello, i have tested the changes for dashboard and provided feedback to Chris. I also provided feedback to Jon on screenflow. Once those changes are fixed, I approve deploying the changes to production. Thank you for all your help and have a wonderful weekend!

Front End Engineer [5:20 PM]  
ive pushed my changes up to master

Back End Engineer #1 [5:27 PM]  
@chhavi:  Um… @chrisaddapp is offline and hasn’t told me anything.  So I’m assuming that since you’re giving change orders after 5 pm on a friday to people working in eastern time zone that you’re ok with these changes not going live until monday or later.

Also I’m not comfortable at this point with deploying anything to production until you have a chance to review it on staging.  There’s been too many miscommunications on this project.  once it goes onto production its difficult to roll back so it needs to be right.

Product Manager [5:46 PM]  
@back_end_engineer_#1 great point Scott and completely aligned with you on not deploying any changes unless confirmed by the engineers working on it. If @chris hasn’t confirmed the fixes to you, we should hold off on deploying those changes. I did test the changes in the staging server though and hence had feedback provided for Chris and Jon. @chrisaddapp please confirm once the fixes have been made. Thank you and have a great weekend!
