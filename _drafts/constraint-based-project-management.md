title: Constraint Based Project Management

I recently picked up responsibility for Engineering at a local, fan run science fiction convention, [Starbase Indy](https://www.starbaseindy.org) and it let me use of one my favorite management techniques, **Constraint Based Project Management**.  I suspect that this is a thing in some sort of formal project management thinking, with an actual name, but I've always referred to it this way.  I started doing this a long, long time ago when I had to ship software back in the days of physical manuals and floppy discs.

The idea behind constraint based project management is that you apply this in the time running up to the event (or software release).  In this case, I'm using it for an **event**.  I generally start this exactly **4 weeks** before the event and my process is to figure out all the constraints:

* **People Resources** - how many people are available to help and who are they?
* **Dates that Have to Be Met** - what are the dates in question?
* **Tasks** - what has to be done?
* **Dollar Resources** - can money be spent to address any of the above constraints; sometimes a small bit of money can easily solve a problem.

So for this event, here are the constraints planned out.

## People Resources

The following people are guaranteed resources:

* Scott
* Shelley
* Dave

There are also roughly a dozen volunteer resources that are supposed to show up buy that isn't guaranteed so everything has to be accomplishable by these three people.

## Dates that Have to Be Met

When you ship software, dates are rarely "hard".  Software can almost always slip into the future but when you have an event, well, the dates are **absolute** and have to be met.


* **Dates**

## Tasks

## Dollars


## Publishing This

The final output of all this is something really, really simple -- a single printed calendar of the month leading up to the event.  I find that this isn't a computer printed thing
