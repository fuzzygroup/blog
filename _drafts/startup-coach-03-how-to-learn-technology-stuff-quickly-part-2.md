## How You Can Learn Technology Stuff Today

This is a continuation of [Startup Coach 02].

So here's my central thesis:

> If I could learn enough about technology to launch a successful software company way back in 1987 using nothing but paper magazines as my learning vehicle, if you have the whole, damn Internet at your beck and call and you claim you can't learn what you need then you're not actually trying.

I know that sounds harsh but the world of startups is absolutely harsh so consider this a bit of a life lesson.

Now that I have delivered the lecture, let's talk about how to learn something with this example for your context:

* You want to start a medical software company in the area of applying machine learning technology 
* You are a domain expert in the medical field but not a technologist

Here are the three questions that I would ask myself:

1. How do I learn best?
2. What opportunities do I have for learning?
3. What's my learning goal?
4. How Can I Immerse Myself?

Each of these is discussed below.

### How Do I Learn Best?

The first thing that I would start with is by asking the question, of myself, "how do I learn best?".  For example:

* Some people are readers who learn from words
* Some people are networkers who learn from other people
* Some people are audio learners who can learn from listening
* Some people are experiential learners who have to learn by doing
* Some people need to watch something to learn it

Personally I'm a cross between a reader and an experiential learner.  That means that for me I need to find places to read content as my starting point to learn something and then I need to solidify the learning by doing something with it

### What Opportunities Do I Have for Learning?

I started this when I was 14 and I didn't have life constraints like a wife or children.  And those constraints, as **absolutely wonderful** as they are, certainly place time boundaries on your ability to learn.  The types of opportunities that are fantastic for learning are regular blocks of time without much interruption.  An obvious example of this is your **daily commute** if you have one.  If you have a commute of say 40 minutes to work and 40 minutes from work then you have 5 * 80 or 400 minutes per week (that's 6.66 hours) as a block of time when you can learn.  And if you work 50 weeks per year then you have 50 * 400 minutes or 333 hours of time for learning.

Now a commute time block may not be a match for your learning style if you are driving and your learning style is reading but if you can learn from an audio source (or even video if you simply turn your phone's screen off) then commute time can be a fantastic learning opportunity.

### What's My Learning Goal?

I look at the the process of learning something technical along two axes:

* Am I learning to do it myself?
* Or am I learning to not be taken advantage of?

These are two distinctly different styles of learning.  Learning something technical so you can do it yourself is pretty damn hard with today's technology simply because of the distinct "geologic stratas of knowledge you need to master" (different essay that I hope to write someday).

I would argue that most business folk that "need to learn something technical" in a startup context are doing so, really, to not get taken advantage of.  If you are a business person and you need to get technical work done, well, it can be a lot like walking onto a used car lot when you know not one damn thing about cars -- you are simply ripe pickings for the first opportunist who finds you.
