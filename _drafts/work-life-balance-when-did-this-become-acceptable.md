Once upon a time, not so long ago, I had to say to someone who reports to me this:

> Hey.  Bob (my manager) asked me to tell you that you should start reading up on Ansible in your off hours.

What.  The.  Hell.  When did our work life balance get so out of whack that our managers now don't see anything wrong with telling us WHAT TO READ WHEN WE AREN'T AT WORK???

I cannot remember the last time I've felt as morally dirty and compromised as I did in that moment.  As a full time employee, which this person was, he is expected to work 40 hours per week.  If a new skill is **required** for his job then shouldn't he get to pick it up on the job?  Sheesh.
