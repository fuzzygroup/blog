I'm writing this on my return from the ConFusion convention or **con**.  Overall ConFusion was an outstanding con and, to help me decide whether to return next year (and the answer is not only Yes but Hell Yes).  In short ConFusion was **outstandingly awesome**.

## Note - I'm a Noob and I am Writing this For Myself

I've been a science fiction reader for my entire life; ever since I discovered the books with a rocket ship on the spine at the Mamaroneck Public Library.  And since we moved away from Mamaroneck when I was 8 years old, well, I've been a science fiction reader for at least 44 years.  And while I've been a reader forever, I've been an active con participant for only about a year.  Yes I went to cons before that but I never really participated and involvement makes a difference.  

So when I look at someone like my good friend Lexi Taylor who, seemingly, came into her very existence at cons / ren faires and the like, well, I'm a damn noob (in my head, like Athena, she came into being, fully formed at a midwest, fan run con).  So in my writing this out, well, I'm explaining stuff to myself.
