<p>If you're looking for a serious engineer / architect who understands Search / Blogging / Social Software / RSS / Atom / Syndicated content / Aggregators / {insert similar stuff here} that's built and scaled a LAMP application from nothing to millions of daily page views then perhaps we should talk.  I'm not a guy to make a simple but pretty web site.  I'm a real software engineer who builds big, scalable applications.  If that's of interest then click Contact for details on how to reach me.</p>
<p>My hourly rate for short term gigs is $150 / hour.  Like almost all other types of protein (ham, pork, steak, etc) I can be purchased in bulk and my rates go down depending on the length (bulk) of the engagement.  Feel free to ask for a quote.  I'm not cheap and I don't pretend to be  but I do deliver.  In order to let you try before you buy you may want to take me up on one of my "discounted bundles" below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Commando Consulting</strong>.   Need someone to login to your LAMP application and give a quick once over looking for issues?  Had your log files stop logging ?  Discovered your blogging tool no longer works?  Well I offer "Commando Consulting" for just this reason.  Give me a password, a login and access and I can likely solve your problem.<br />
$99 for 1 hour handled via Paypal to fuzzygroup @ gmail.com payable in advance and we'll Skype through out the whole process so you know what I did.</li>
<li><strong>The 1 Hour Critique</strong>.  As four startups have now learned - ZigTag, PodTech and two that asked not to be named I can put on my strategy hat and relate to them on a level that seemed to be helpful.  I'm not really a Valley insider but I've been doing startups since I was 19 (I'm 38 now) and I have a pretty good feel for this stuff.  At the very least I'll challenge your assumptions and I think I have a pretty good insight to the funding process.  Certainly I know the mistakes I've made over the years.<br />
$99 for 1 hour paid in advance via Paypal to fuzzygroup @ gmail.com.  Call handled via Skype.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I'm a sucker for people getting out there and building startups so if you're an<strong> unfunded startup</strong> you can always email me for a possible free consultation. I'm going to offer free services to 5 startups in 2006.  This is an advice service by the way, not free coding.</p>
<p>My preferred development languages are PHP and Python.  My preferred server platform is Linux although I'm known to dabble in BSD as well.  In 2000 I deployed well over a million dollars worth of hardware running Windows 2K so I've done a lot in that space also.</p>
