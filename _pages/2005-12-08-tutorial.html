<p>Although I haven't written any in quite a while, I have a reputation for writing tutorials that people oddly seem to like.  Here are a few of my older ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://scott.feedster.com/?page_id=11">How to use Blogger</a></li>
<li><a href="http://scott.feedster.com/?page_id=13">How to claim a feed in Feedster </a></li>
</ul>
