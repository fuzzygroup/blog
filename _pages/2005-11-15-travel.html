<p>Given that I commute roughly* every other week from Indianapolis to San Francisco, I thought it would be useful if people that wanted to meet with me had dates for my trips out to San Francisco:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fly out 11/17</li>
<li>Attend a wedding in Fresno on 11/18 and 11/19 (leave SF at 3:00 pm PST)</li>
<li>Return to SF on 11/19 morning</li>
<li>Leave SF for Thanksgiving on 11/23 at the absolute crack of dawn.  </li>
</ul>
<p>I haven't yet scheduled my next trip to CA for the reason* below.</p>
<p>*Technically its every other week but, given that my wife, has ripped the tendons in her ankle and can't walk or drive, its going to be erratic for the next few months I fear. </p>
