Despite my mildly fanatical adherence to MySQL, there really is nothing wrong with Postgres and quite a bit to like.  Given that Postgres is the default database for Heroku, I am spending more and more time using Postgres these days.  What I've found is that my resistance to Postgres, more than anything else, was simply that I was really, really used to the MySQL command line and shell. 

What I've found is that if you pair [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/) with Postgres then it makes a very easy transition from MySQL.  Postico is a wonderfully written app (yes I'm a paid user now) that provides a great DB viewing and manipulation tool right down to row level editing.  I found myself today, rather than writing a web form to update the database simply editing the data with Postico.  Given how easily I generate CRUD apps, that's a pretty big step for me.
