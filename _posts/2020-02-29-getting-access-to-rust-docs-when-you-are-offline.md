title: Getting Access to Rust Docs When You are Offline
category: rust
tags: ["rust", "docs"]

This one is short but simple since I didn't have it on my last flight and I fly again tomorrow.  To access your Rust documentation when you aren't online:

    rustup docs --book

That brings up a browser with a full implementation of the rust docs. 

There is also the magic of [devdocs.io](https://devdocs.io/r) but that requires that you were wise enough to have pre-clicked the install for offline option.  And, alas, I was not.
