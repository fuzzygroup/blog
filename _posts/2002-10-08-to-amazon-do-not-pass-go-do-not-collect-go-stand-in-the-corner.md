<p>It's been a few days without a real rant (flexes his fingers) so here goes.&nbsp; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013031121/http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>: </p>
<p align="center">WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ????</p>
<p>I was over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013031121/http://www.geocaching.com/">GeoCaching</a> and noticed that there is a cache in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013031121/http://www.geocaching.com/seek/nearest_cache.asp?zip=01908&amp;submit1=Submit">Nahant</a>.&nbsp; Go figure.&nbsp; It's like a mile from me.&nbsp; This might be enough to finally get me to buy a GPS.&nbsp; As always, with consumer electronics, I'm the last around to get one (I only got a DVD player a few months ago) since I can't write it off, I know it won't work right and will just be difficult.&nbsp; So anyway I surfed over to Amazon and searched for GPS and then selected the 278 results in Electronics.&nbsp; And got a list of results.&nbsp; Hmmm.... $250 odd is more than I want to spend for a GPS.&nbsp; So I'll just use "Sort by" and sort by price.&nbsp; And then I saw this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013031121/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-form/ref=s_e_rs/002-4202734-9602408">fine bit of blithering, pathetic idiocy</a> that just boggles my (admittedly little) mind:</p>

<p align="left">You can't sort by price.&nbsp; You&nbsp;can't sort by price!&nbsp; Go figure.&nbsp; One of the very real advantages of shopping on a computer is something like sorting.&nbsp; Yes I know that I can look by "Best Selling" and then infer a price relationship since cheaper tends to sell more but that's just not the same.&nbsp; And then I said to myself "Wait I know that Amazon's crew of largely Perl monkeys can sort a database by price" so let's see if they do it elsewhere like in books.&nbsp; So I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013031121/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=books&amp;field-keywords=Xmen&amp;search-type=ss&amp;bq=1/002-4202734-9602408">did</a> and got this:&nbsp; </p>

<p align="left">That's right -- search for a book and you can sort by price but search for electronics where sorting by price really matters and you can't.&nbsp; Go figure.&nbsp; That's a stupid revenue optimization strategy or it's bad product management.</p>
<p align="left">New slogan for Amazon's programmers: "Amazon.&nbsp; First we'll take away your ability to sort by price and then tomorrow we'll remove the search engine."</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I have no bias against Amazon.&nbsp; I use them frequently and I think they absolutely rock.&nbsp; Things like this frustrate the ever loving crap out of me since they can do better.&nbsp; I'm a fan and I want Amazon to do well.&nbsp; For all their flaws they have done a good job and I hope they succeed.&nbsp; They even released an XML based webservice API.&nbsp; And now this.&nbsp; Sigh.</p>
