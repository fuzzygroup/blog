This Marketing 101 piece is very short.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Well after you read it, you'll understand.&nbsp;

### This Guy is Smart!!! Or How to Get People to Read Your Email

I just got the following email from [John](http://www.englers.org/):

> <font size="2">
> <p>Scott,</p>
> <p>read this :</p>
> <p><a href="http://www.englers.org/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=251">a link here</a> <em>(text version of link in email replaced "a link here" due to the length of the link)</em></p>
> <p>it's quick... and yes you should be using Adium if you're not.</p>
> <p>John</p></font>

Here's what was so damn smart about it:

- The email was **short**.&nbsp; How many times have you opened an email and found it to be long and said to yourself "I'll read this later; I don't have the mental energy for it right now".&nbsp; You put it aside until later and then never return to it.&nbsp; Anyone who sends an email has to understand that people today are **busy**.&nbsp; We all have good intentions (yes I really do have faith in people) but we're all overworked, overtired, overstressed, etc.&nbsp; Short works well.&nbsp; Now when it's the right person, there is nothing wrong with long emails (and I would have gladly read a long email from John since previous dialog has built up the trust relationship between us but my making it short, he _dramatically raised_ the probability of my reading it).  
  
- He sets my expectations **in advance**"it's quick".&nbsp; I've written in the past about committment&nbsp;and here is just another example.&nbsp; Following a link is a **commitment**.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Horse puckey" you think.&nbsp; "Now Scott has really lost it; it's just a damn link".&nbsp; Well... Not really.&nbsp; Anything that involves **my time** is a commitment.&nbsp; Think about the amount of email you get daily and the quantity that has a url attached.&nbsp; That's what, say,&nbsp;60 urls?&nbsp; Sure some of it may be spam but we all get a lot of mail these days.&nbsp; And in this blogosphere of ours, it's probably higher.&nbsp; If you assume that the average time to click on a url and then just scan (not read but scan) the destination web page is 30 seconds, that's: 
  - **30 minutes** per day or&nbsp;  
  
  - **3 1/2**  **_hours_** per week or   
  
  - **182**  **_hours_** per year or   
  
  - **7.583**  **_days_** per year or   
  - **1.583 weeks** per year  
  
- Now I'm not going to tell you that we all work out in our heads the mail on the time spent following urls in emails; we don't at all.&nbsp; What we have is an overall subliminal perception in our heads that this stuff takes time and maybe we just shouldn't bother.&nbsp; When John told me " **it's quick**", he alerted me that it wouldn't take long.&nbsp; John's a regular reader as far as I know and he's making the logical inference that I'm busy (probably since he sees the quantity of blog drivel I produce) and being unbelievably considerate of my time.&nbsp; That's very, very cool.&nbsp; Kudos to John on this.&nbsp; And, yes, I'm a huge believer in good manners; despite what some of my invective filled writing might make you think.  
  
- He added a personal recommendation " **and yes you should be using Audium...**".&nbsp; I'm&nbsp;a firm believer that if you don't really know what you are doing in a geeky area you seek the opinion of someone who does.&nbsp; I know John's a better Mac guy than I am so I'm going to trust him here.&nbsp; I'm not sure if John knows that but a **personal recommendation** works for me as it does for many people.&nbsp; I could also describe this as it "plays in peoria" (an old Americanism phrase indicating this; no idea where it came from).&nbsp; In a world that is all too often increasingly anonymous, personal works.

Nicely done John, nicely done!!!&nbsp; Thanks Man.&nbsp; Next time I'm on an OSX system it's pretty much a given that I'll not only download [Audium](http://www.adiumx.com/) but these emoticons as well.
