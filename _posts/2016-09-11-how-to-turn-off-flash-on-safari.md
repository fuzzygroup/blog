Well I just got to start my recreational vacation coding by dealing with my MacBook going completely nuts and coming close to a full power cycle.  I hate power cycling my hardware.  A quick trip to Activity Monitor showed the issue was Flash support in Safari so its time to go:

* Safari Menu
* Preferences
* Security tab
* Internet Plugins Settings
* Uncheck Flash Adobe Flash Player
