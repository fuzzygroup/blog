* Should airlines be required to provide multiple seats to obese people ?
* Does your work place treat everyone fairly?
* Can anyone be successful in the USA?
* Does the USA live up to its ideals of racial diversity?
* Do women have the same opportunities as men?
* Do people of color have the same opportunities as white people?
* Peanut butter racism
* Blind spot bias you may have bias that you see in others but can't see in yourself
* White fragility by d Angelo 
* MTV micro aggressions
