<p>Its that whole Zen Koan thing:</p>
<blockquote><p>If a tree fell in the forest and no one was there to see, did it fall at all ?</p></blockquote>
<p>The Web 2.0 developer version of this would be:</p>
<blockquote><p>If a feature fell in the forest and you were the only one awake in the company to know you just did something wicked cool, was it really cool ?  Or were you just a stressed out geek ?</p></blockquote>
<p>Sigh.  Anyway.  Ajax is **interesting**.  Hopefully coolness to come soon.  And I figured out my first Python project to boot.</p>
