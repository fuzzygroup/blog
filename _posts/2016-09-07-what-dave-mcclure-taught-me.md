Feedster was not the first company I raised money for but it was the first time I raised money from true silicon valley investors.  I vividly remember [Scott Rafer](https://fuzzygroup.github.io/blog/startup/2016/09/02/what-scott-rafer-taught-me.html) taking me around all the different angel groups, individual investors and Sand Hill Road.  One of those investors was [Dave McClure](https://twitter.com/davemcclure) of [500 Startups](http://500.co) fame.  

Dave was one of our angel investors the the one that I felt personally responsible for.  So, after the awful day that I was let go from Feedster, I remember sitting in my apartment in Indianapolis and having to call Dave around 6 pm on a cold fall night and telling him that I was gone and I couldn't look out for his investment any longer.  He took the news far better than I expected and wasn't even angry or disappointed with me much to my surprise.  His actual concern was how I was taking everything.  Looking back at this, I can now see it a little differently:

* We were just one of many investments that he had
* The amount wasn't all that large
* Preserving the relationship with the entrepreneur is more important; they'll do something else

So here's what Dave McClure taught me:

{:.center}
**Not everything works out.  And that's ok.**

{:.center}
**Relationships matter.  Keep relationships strong no matter what.**

Now I don't think I've talked to Dave in years at this point but the truth of it is that I'm still impressed by how well he handled this and I still remember it vividly.  And If anyone ever asked me if they should take Dave on as an investor, I'd answer "Yes; a thousand times yes."
