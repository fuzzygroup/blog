description: How can Medium have such basic problems with usability at this stage in its life?
---
Yesterday I was at the movies with my son and during the endless roll of trailers, promos and advertisements, I was terribly, terribly bored so I dropped into the Medium app and saw something that I **knew** I wanted to read in more depth so I hearted it (by hearted I mean I clicked on the heart icon on the toolbar and watched it change color).  I figured that would be enough to find it later.  I also remembered a little bit about it:

* author: james altschuler
* keywords: hedge fund marriage thestreet.com 

Just to cut to the chase, here's the [exact article](https://medium.com/the-mission/step-by-step-guide-to-make-10-million-and-then-totally-blow-it-a9283b6de90c) but the process by which I found something that I had:

* already read
* that I had hearted as a favorite
* that I knew had certain keywords

was an absolute usability failure and one that I just don't understand.

# Usability Failure #1 - Where Are My Hearted Things?

The next day I went to Medium in my laptop's browser and signed in and I **could not** find the things I liked.  So I looked again, nope.  My next thought was ok maybe these are just stored in the Medium app on my phone -- nope I couldn't find anything there either.  This led me back to my laptop's browser where I finally googled it and found a [Quora post](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-find-a-list-of-all-the-articles-I-recommended-on-Medium) that talked about it but their solution was no longer part of the Medium user interface.  They also pointed out that you could goto http://medium.com/@user/has-recommended and find your posts.  I typed in the correct url for me: [http://medium.com/@fuzzygroup/has-recommended](http://medium.com/@fuzzygroup/has-recommended) and that actually did work but the question remains:

> Medium has serious founders, serious money, serious talent -- how can this be a problem?

**Note**: I never did find a way to get back to my hearted items on my phone.

# Usability Failure #2 - Search

When I couldn't find the article I **knew** was there, I turned to search as the next obvious way to find it.  Here was my process:

1.  So I started with a search for [james altschuler](https://medium.com/search?q=james%20altschuler) and that gave zero hits.  
2.  Then I continued with a search for [thestreet.com](https://medium.com/search?q=thestreet.com) and that gave me hits but not the article I knew I had read.  Now I have no problem with a spelling error on altschuler but "thestreet.com" -- **nope**.
3.  I then proceeded to search for [hedge fund](https://medium.com/search?q=hedge%20fund) and again the article that I wanted wasn't there.
4.  Ok I'll accept that there are lots and lots of articles about hedge funds but how many [hedge fund articles talk about the collapse of his marriage](https://medium.com/search?q=hedge%20fund%20marriage) - that must work, right?  Nope.  That three word query brings back just a [single article](https://medium.com/thinkprogress/hedge-fund-manager-runs-anti-gay-attack-ad-against-liz-cheney-2e851c82b758).  Interestingly Google finds [360 things](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1313&bih=646&q=site%3Amedium.com+%22hedge+fund%22+%22marriage%22&oq=site%3Amedium.com+%22hedge+fund%22+%22marriage%22&gs_l=psy-ab.3...34964.39387.0.39831.4.4.0.0.0.0.62.207.4.4.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..0.0.0.FNpHjvAPKsM) on medium that contain hedge fund and marriage and the post I was looking for was on the second page.  I ran the google search with "hedge fund" and "marriage" to force all the terms to be in there as well as to treat "hedge fund" as a string.

# How Did I Finally Find It?

I finally ended up giving up on Medium's user interface and its search engine and using my incorrect version of the author's name and [Google found the right author as the very first result](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Amedium.com%20james%20altschuler).  I then scrolled down and found [the article](https://medium.com/the-mission/step-by-step-guide-to-make-10-million-and-then-totally-blow-it-a9283b6de90c).

# Conclusion

By any Silicon Valley standards, Medium is a real thing: 

* [5 years old](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_(website))
* Incredible Founder - Blogger and Twitter were Ev's prior companies
* Huge $$$ - More than [$107 Million](https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/21/medium-series-c/)
* Has north of [167 employees](https://www.quora.com/How-many-employees-does-Medium-have-What-do-they-do) as of November 2015

It is very, very hard for me to understand this level of usability failure at a company with these type of metrics.  I can, perhaps, excuse the user interface to hearted items as being a redesign where something got lost in the shuffle.  But the search failure is deeply, deeply troubling.  If you're in the content business then search is a **requirement** not an option and a search algorithm that: 

* deals with misspellings
* takes into account user input such as hearts / likes
* actually finds the damn keywords the user puts in 

should not be a problem in 2017.  I'm spent my career in search in retrieval and we were solving these types of issue back in the early 90s if not sooner.  I just can't fathom exactly what Medium is doing but they would likely be better served at this point by just embedding google instead of whatever search tool they've
