title: Good Riddance to Zoom or Video Conferencing Is Still Not the Future

Over the past 11 months or so I've had the opportunity to fairly regularly use a video conferencing tool known as [Zoom](http://www.zoom.us) and I'm finally rid of it and **thank heavens**.  Ever since I stopped using it, I'm free of:

* absolute CPU killing performance; now that I am not using it any more, my machine is fast again
* the requirement to always have a shirt on - I work from home and my office gets hot at times
* getting nattered at about not always facing the camera; I have multiple machines so I can get work done while video conferencing is running
* constant log in and log out issues when you have multiple machines like, oh I don't know - iPhone, iPad, laptop; not an uncommon use case now a days.
* its many user interface idiocies including the fact that they want you have a "zoom number" which is like a phone number without the chunking.  So if you have to type it in manually, which for me happens constantly, you have to try and read this:

The stupidest thing of all on this last point is that the damn system understands a chunked phone number because it formats the number for you when you type it in.  Why they can't generate the url like this: http://zoom.us/j/649-428-379 and then just throw away the dashes, I do not know.  The whole reason the US has area codes is because of [chunking and its not hard to understand](http://blog.screensteps.com/chunking-information).  Even if we're not trying to remember it permanently, its easier to visually see and type it in. Why don't I want to use the link?  Well I'm a developer and my calendar isn't always on the box where I want to take a video call.
