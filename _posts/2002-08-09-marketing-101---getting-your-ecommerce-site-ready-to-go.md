paolovalde: Scott?   
fuzzygroup: Yes  
paolovalde: [http://store.evectors.com/](http://store.evectors.com/)   
paolovalde: Almost ready to go&nbsp;   
fuzzygroup: ok  
fuzzygroup: I need to do that transaction then, right ?  
paolovalde: No, we've already tested it   
paolovalde: And now we are moving on the real bank server   
paolovalde: So it's going to be "real" money&nbsp;   
fuzzygroup: oh. ok. sorry. gretch's dad got worse so I'm running where her project load and my own. Hence the more busy than my usual insanity.  
paolovalde: Ok, don't worry, I wrote all stuff myself. It's not perfect but it's probably better than nothing   
fuzzygroup: ok. Do i have edit rights on that url? If so I'll make the time to clean it up.  
paolovalde: Nope, I'll create an account for you.   
fuzzygroup: ok  
fuzzygroup: looking at it now.  
paolovalde: gimme a temp password for your account...   
paolovalde: (you can change it later   
fuzzygroup: logan1p  
fuzzygroup: Please tell me the account name that you use  
paolovalde: scott   
paolovalde: I use paolo   
paolovalde: yours is scott/logan1p   
fuzzygroup: thank you  
fuzzygroup: i'm in. Is it safe to edit now?  
paolovalde: Yes, I'm working on the radiotools site   
fuzzygroup: cool. I'm on it in 5.  
fuzzygroup: Yikes. Broken links on the home page. I'm fixing.  
paolovalde: No wait   
paolovalde: Where?   
fuzzygroup: radio.userlamd.com  
paolovalde: Ok, seen it   
fuzzygroup: m not n  
paolovalde: Go ahead   
fuzzygroup: so am i fixing or are you ?  
paolovalde: I'm giving an interview to a canadia journalist at the moment...   
fuzzygroup: ok. I'll do it  
paolovalde's status is now "Available" (8/9/2002 at 11:01 AM)  
fuzzygroup: Pretty much completely rewrote it. [http://store.evectors.com/itproducts/story$num=2&amp](http://store.evectors.com/itproducts/story$num=2&amp);sec=1  
fuzzygroup: [http://www.fuzzygroup.net/fuzzyoffice/changelog.php?project=evectors](http://www.fuzzygroup.net/fuzzyoffice/changelog.php?project=evectors) is a log of changes I am making. I'll disable security for you temporarily so you can use it today.  
fuzzygroup: disabled. link above should work. no idea how it looks on a mac.  
paolovalde: I see it, it looks ok.   
fuzzygroup: ok.   
fuzzygroup: doing rss now  
paolovalde: I don't know if you've seen this, but for this page ([http://store.evectors.com/itbasket/story$num=13](http://store.evectors.com/itbasket/story$num=13)) I had found a link to a yahoo currency converter (chich is somehow more official)   
fuzzygroup: that's fine to substitute it.  
fuzzygroup: Joel's thing is a bookmarklet which is nice but not required.  
fuzzygroup: the link should be on the page where the user has the currency concern though   
fuzzygroup: or it won't make it to the basket.  
paolovalde: I agree.   
paolovalde: Joel's thing doesn't work on the mac...   
fuzzygroup: am i updating it or are you ?  
paolovalde: Better go with the yahoo   
paolovalde: I can do it   
fuzzygroup: sigh. crappy macs. ok. \*teasing\*  
fuzzygroup: I'll tell him. He's a good guy  
fuzzygroup: I just added a tag line to Rss Distiller on the home page. Tell me if you like it and I'll figure out one for ThemeTool.  
fuzzygroup: You should offer a bundle of both products for a discount also. Make it easy to spend more money at one time and people will.  
paolovalde: Yes, I had already thought of this one, the problem is that the registration system (the one sending you the serial numbers) does not support this at the moment.   
fuzzygroup: lol  
paolovalde: We'll introduce this in a couple of weeks...   
paolovalde: Anyway, since we're giving away the 30 days trial, I think that nothing special will happen in the near future   
fuzzygroup: don't be so sure.  
fuzzygroup: strange things happen and you if you are putting a payment infrastructure up, it's got to work.  
paolovalde: It does work, we only don't support bundles yet.   
fuzzygroup: ah  
paolovalde: But maybe I found a solution... diggin'   
paolovalde: Btw: the tagline is great!   
fuzzygroup: ok. I'll do one for themetool  
fuzzygroup: ThemeTool. Easily Make Your Blog Look Sexy.  
fuzzygroup: how's that ?  
paolovalde: Have you ever heard of a Canadian bsuness magazine named "Report on Business"?   
fuzzygroup: nope  
paolovalde: How about: ThemeTool: Make Your Blog Look Sexy. Easily.   
fuzzygroup: That's fine.  
fuzzygroup: ThemeTool: Make Your Blog Look Sexy. Easily. No Fooling Around.  
fuzzygroup: or No Kidding.  
fuzzygroup: the radio commmunity knows that his is hard  
fuzzygroup: might piss off dave though  
paolovalde: I like No Kidding more...   
fuzzygroup: ok  
paolovalde: And it's not going to piss of anyone, I think (I mean, no fooling around was heavier)   
fuzzygroup: ok  
fuzzygroup: Rss distiller is rewritten. Can you add the yahoo link ?  
paolovalde: ok   
fuzzygroup: there's one extra carriage return to eliminate also  
fuzzygroup: I passed it thru word also  
paolovalde: ok, removed it   
fuzzygroup: thx  
paolovalde: The short description is too long (it's the one that ends up in the TOC on the right)   
paolovalde: I would cut it to: Create RSS news feeds from almost any web page   
fuzzygroup: that's fine  
fuzzygroup: you or me doing it?  
paolovalde: I   
fuzzygroup: k  
fuzzygroup: I have a 5 pm programming deadline which I haven't started on yet. What's the announce date on this site ?  
paolovalde: Now + 1,5hrs   
fuzzygroup: can I make a suggestion to you  
paolovalde: sure   
fuzzygroup: don't be silly.  
fuzzygroup: Release it on Monday  
fuzzygroup: or tuesday  
fuzzygroup: You get so much extra bang for the buck.  
fuzzygroup: People like \*timely\* news  
fuzzygroup: and this won't be \*timely\*  
fuzzygroup: Also we need a press release, etc  
paolovalde: The whole company is closing for 2 weeks, meaning that I get it right now or it's going to be September.   
fuzzygroup: oh frack  
fuzzygroup: now + 5 hours it is  
fuzzygroup: I can do more tonight but not really now unless I finish enough on my 5 pm deadline  
paolovalde: I mean, I don't necessarily have to announce it, but the site is going to be there in 1,5 hrs.   
fuzzygroup: Any other pages you think need attention?  
fuzzygroup: Well I'm fine with it being live  
fuzzygroup: but not announced  
fuzzygroup: and if you are closed then who does customer service once you are selling ?  
fuzzygroup: there will be questions   
paolovalde: Don't worry, I think it's ok, we can open it and then see   
paolovalde: We've been supporting these tools anyway for 6 months, we know how it works.   
paolovalde: I don't think that this will change much   
fuzzygroup: Ok  
fuzzygroup: you aren't answering the question though  
paolovalde: Oh, sorry:   
fuzzygroup: is there anyone who is answering the emails when they come in ? and you are closed for 2 weeks  
fuzzygroup: i'm not saying it don't work.  
paolovalde: I'm doing all the customer service for these tools, and I'm going to be available   
paolovalde: Ok?   
fuzzygroup: ok then.  
fuzzygroup: Yup.  
fuzzygroup: totally.  
paolovalde:&nbsp;   
fuzzygroup: blogging is too tight knit right now to not answer stuff promptly.  
paolovalde: Yup   
fuzzygroup: are you routing them to a [support@evectors.com](mailto:support@evectors.com) alias ?  
fuzzygroup: or .it alias ?  
paolovalde: Yup   
fuzzygroup: good  
fuzzygroup: perfect.  
paolovalde: There's [info@evectors](mailto:info@evectors), [staff@evectors](mailto:staff@evectors). [support@evectors](mailto:support@evectors), etc.   
paolovalde: All alias to my address   
fuzzygroup: i'd recommend [help@](mailto:help@ )also. people sometimes try that.  
fuzzygroup: ok so I should budget for a marketing 101 piece on "Getting Your ECommerce Site Ready to Go" on Monday. Sound good ?  
paolovalde: I think there's a link in all pages, there are specific addresses such as [rssdistiller@evectors](mailto:rssdistiller@evectors)   
paolovalde: Gr8   
fuzzygroup: and any chance can get the original content so I can show before and after ?  
fuzzygroup: if so just email it to me  
fuzzygroup: sorry for not saving it. should have thought more.  
paolovalde: Nope, sorry: it's lost   
fuzzygroup: crapola.  
fuzzygroup: i thought ideatools kept it around?  
fuzzygroup: or is it just deletes that are kept ?  
paolovalde: If it had been written more than 6 hrs ago I could have got a backup, but this was recent and there's no versioning on this site.   
fuzzygroup: ah.  
fuzzygroup: I'll kludge togther faked before text then. that ok with you ?
