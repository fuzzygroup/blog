Well I’ve made the decision to start down the rabbit hole, once again, and learn something new.  I’ve decided to go for [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) as a language and[Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/) as a web framework.  These nicely parallel the Ruby / Rails ecosystem which I’ve been full time in since 2007. I’ll use this blog to capture the learning process.
