title: Nerd Humor - When You Blog in Bright Sunlight in a Convertible

Disclaimer: There is likely only one person on the planet who will find this funny.  Hi!

So I found myself last night in a convertible with my wife driving and I thought to myself, "I know; I'll write something".  And I began writing a screed on the use of the underlying Rails Migration commands that manipulate the state of your database.  Rails has a number of these commands that, after MORE THAN A DECADE of daily rails programming, I've never bothered to use.  I have known for a long time I need to master these and I finally have.  

I finish up that post this morning and go to find it and publish it and a git status shows me **nothing**.  Gulp.  This just doesn't happen to me.  Scramble around looking for it -- no love.  Confirm that it actually exists in my editor and I didn't just have a surreal "out of keyboard" experience -- yep.  It is there.  And then it hits me -- I have multiple blogs, one for nerd writing and one for recipes.  Yep:

Moral of the story?  Don't tech blog where you food blog.  Sigh.
