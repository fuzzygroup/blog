I'm in the process of gearing up for a return to the freelance lifestyle.  One thing I've never done, since I started as a real freelancer, is actually use accounting software.  I know, I know, I know -- bad decision.  Well accounting and taxes are among my least favorite things in life so that's why I've justified it but that's kind of being a child about it.  Ignoring something does not make it better so one of my 2017 resolutions was "Deal with Accounting / Taxes". 

# Requirements

Here are my requirements for an accounting tool for freelancers in 2017:

* cloud based / hosted
* ability to bill clients
* ability to record an invoice but NOT actually send it (I don't necessarily want to lost X% to credit card processing)
* mobile app (ios)
* ability to make an invoice
* ability to record a client
* time tracking is possibly desirable but unclear

# Options

I looked at three options: 

* Quicken
* Hurdlr
* FreshBooks

## QuickBooks

Like, I suspect every other entrepreneur, I've used Quick Books in the past so it was my first stop along this path.  Sadly, for what should be such a strong product, I rejected it almost immediately.  The version I was examining was the very low end, $10 / month version, [Quick Books Self Employed](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/var/pricing/) - left most option.  Here's what I found wrong with it:

* As a web product it is incredibly slow (to amuse myself, I tried holding my breath during page refreshes; sometimes I wasn't able to)
* It is very, very limited. For example there wasn't a way to cleanly track clients.
* It felt like it had been designed poorly at best.  My guess is that the product manager has never been a freelancer him or herself and it really, really shows.
* Just the fact that googling for QuickBooks self employed takes me to a [page where it isn't even listed](https://search2.quickbooks.com/get-quickbooks?gclid=Cj0KEQiAwrbEBRDqxqzMsrTGmogBEiQAeSE6ZQUoreXe38AFn6v2IcG49NYFmZBf527SNNUwB5lqGRsaAo5t8P8HAQ&s_kwcid=AL!2419!3!147086503826!p!!g!!quicken&ef_id=WIkw5QAABM0ZEIG4:20170129112821:s) tells me that my business isn't a priority for Intuit
* It is strong on the traditional tax side of things and that's a plus but account software should help me run my business not just my taxes.

## Hurdlr

I found [Hurdlr](https://hurdlr.com/) somewhere and I'm intrigued by the promise and absolutely terrified by the reality.  This is a brand new app / website seemingly and they're not even charging yet.  Sure I can use it for free -- and what happens when they fail?  Can I get my data back?  Can I trust them with passwords to my bank account?  Will they stay in business?  They do a good job of talking the talk but I'm not going thru this selection process again.  I hate to not risk my efforts on a startup given my predilections for startups but this is just too risky.

## FreshBooks

Surprisingly to me I ended up picking [FreshBooks](https://www.freshbooks.com/) as my choice.  Here's how it matched up against my criteria:

* cloud based / hosted - **YES**
* ability to bill clients - **YES**
* ability to record an invoice but NOT actually send it - **YES**
* mobile app (ios) - **YES**.  Please note that you want the Cloud Accounting app.
* ability to make an invoice - **YES**
* ability to record a client - **YES**
* time tracking is possibly desirable but unclear - **YES**

I've had one problem so far - expense import brought in far more than I wanted but Support helped me out and did a great job.

I have the app on my phone; my wife has it on her phone and for the first time since I've been a freelancer, I have a heads up view as to the money that's coming in.  Honestly it feels fantastic.

# Further Reading

While FreshBooks was right for me, you may need more information.  I found very good info on the [CarefulCents.com](http://www.carefulcents.com/) site.
