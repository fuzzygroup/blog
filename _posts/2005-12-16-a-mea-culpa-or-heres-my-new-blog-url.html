<p>Dear Blogging Community as a Whole,</p>
<p>I wanted to say I'm sorry.  I've violated one of <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/">Scoble's</a> core blogging rules i.e. "Don't change your blog / feed url" often (if ever).  Well I've done that all too often but I now have a new url:</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://fuzzyblog.com/">http://fuzzyblog.com/</a></p>
<div align="center">-or-</div>
<div align="center"><a href="http://fuzzyblog.com/feed/">http://fuzzyblog.com/feed/</a></div>
<div align="left"></div>
<div align="left">And since that meets these criteria:</div>
<div align="left">
<ol>
<li>Is using a great product that I do honestly love (WordPress)</li>
<li>Is a domain that i control completely and runs on my own server</li>
<li>Lets me hack on the code base</li>
<li>Has allowed me to finally merge my old Radio blog entries (I have a Radio to WordPress plugin I'll release soon), I'll have a critical mass of content there, enough that I won't change things again. And if you think I'm doing this as a forcing event to keep myself honest, well, who am I to tell you different?</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div align="left">So thanks everyone.  See you at the FuzzyBlog.</div>
