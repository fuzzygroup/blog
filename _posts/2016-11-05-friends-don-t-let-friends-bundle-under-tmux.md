So I had one of those crazy bundler errors on thursday that just drives you insane.  Among the errors were:

* the git source not yet checked out. Please run `bundle install` before trying to start your application - Google Search
* could not find a valid gem

It was a unending session of **suck** -- so bad that I finally asked [Dv](http://www.dasari.me) to pair with me on it. And he and I tried a number of things and nothing worked.  Then things started to feel oh so [familiar](https://fuzzygroup.github.io/blog/ruby/2016/10/15/brew-xz-and-nokogiri-and-tmux-an-unmitigated-disaster.html).

So, honestly, I give you this:

    Friends Don't Let Friends Bundle Under Tmux
