**Me Speaking on AWS Security 101 at Indy AWS**

A few weeks ago, I happened to find myself at the local [IndyPy meetup](https://www.meetup.com/indypy/) (Python) and they asked for a speaker on "AWS Security 101" and I volunteered.  Two weeks later I gave that presentation.  While I know they made a live stream, I'm not sure who has rights to it / where it lives so I recorded a version of this presentation early this morning from my office and put it on YouTube for my few loyal readers.  Enjoy!
