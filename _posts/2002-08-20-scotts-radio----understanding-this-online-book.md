### Something Unexpected: Scott's Radio

As the author of the [O'Reilly Essential Blogging](http://www.fuzzygroup.net/go/?oreillyfromradio) chapters on Radio, I clearly have a commercial interest in Radio.&nbsp; You'd think that I'd want people to just buy the Essential Blogging book and NOT give content about Radio for free.&nbsp; You'd think that but you'd be wrong.&nbsp; I really want to see Radio do well along with great people like Jake and Lawrence.&nbsp; And more documentation is pretty much always&nbsp;a frothy good thing for products.

So... Inspiration struck me yesterday when I was digging through the 240 gigabytes of digital bile that I call a hard drive(s):

> _O'Reilly cut a lot of my text on the Essential Blogging book.&nbsp; (these are all labeled as "Missing")&nbsp; Why not aggregate that content along with my previous writings on Radio and release it as a free book under the GNU Free Documentation License?&nbsp; This content still gets tons of hits from Google so it's clearly useful.&nbsp;_

A quick demand (ok gentle request) to my partner, Gretchen, for "A really cool cover" and within about an hour, she IM'd me the graphic at left.&nbsp; And I've been in hard core content massage since 3:37 am on this oh so soggy Boston day.&nbsp; I won't tell you that this content is perfect -- there are clearly some broken links and other editing style things that need to get done.&nbsp; But there is a lot of content and it's useful.&nbsp; It'll get improved more over time but following the Open Source mantra of "Release Early and Release Often", I give you:
