<p>I have to send a great big Thank you to <a href="http://grumet.net/weblog/">Andrew</a> and the rest of the folks behind <a href="http://juicereceiver.sourceforge.net/index.php">Juice</a> the once and former iPodder.&nbsp; I'm attending the 2nd Feedster Wedding* and I've downloaded ratloads of Podcasts using them to energize my development process.&nbsp; iPodder just makes it damn near trivial to use podcasts so that's great!&nbsp; Thanks guys.</p>
<p></p>
<p>*Ok mine was the 1st ever Feedster wedding.</p>
