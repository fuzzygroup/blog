<p>So I'm just plain <strong>jonesing</strong> to do the podcast.  That means bandwidth and that means storage.  And the desire to play with stuff that TextDrive* just won't support means that I'm going down the dedicated server route.  Given that I'm an ex-Rackspace customer this really isn't surprising at all to me.  I just like having a box which is dedicated to my whacky adventures.  Example: The ability to install MySQL 5 and start using it in Python.  My TextDrive won't give me that since its shared hosting.  And given that I'm a true MySQL believer and my other buddy <a href="http://openwin.org/mike/wordpress/">Mike</a> says its ready then I want to be all over it.  Stored procedures here I come!<br />
So <a href="http://www.feedblog.org/">Kevin</a> thinks I should go <a href="http://www.serverbeach.com/">ServerBeach</a> and <a href="http://www.socklabs.com/">Nick</a> thinks I should go <a href="http://www.xlhost.com/">XLHost</a>.  XLHost is cheaper and offers remote reboot via the web which is, imho, important.  XLHost also does a better job on the "Sucks" test:</p>

<li><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22xlhost+sucks%22&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official">Sucks Test on XLHost</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So anyone out there have any direct experience with either of these guys ?  Thanks in advance.<br />
*TextDrive which both <a href="http://airhead.typepad.com/">Mike</a> and <a href="http://niallkennedy.com/weblog/">Niall</a> recommended is actually excellent.</p>
