<p>Having read much of Defensive Design, the new 37 Signals book, today during SES travel, I found my experiences downloading a new Linksys driver for my old WPC11 v3 card interesting.  Here's the <a href="http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?childpagename=US%2FLayout&amp;packedargs=c%3DL_Download_C2%26cid%3D1115417109934%26sku%3D1121874576896&amp;pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper">download page</a>.  The 1st download link is, unhelpfully, for the Windows CE version of the driver.  The second is for the Linux driver.  Now I'm all for multiplatform and all but put the most common platform at the top.  Sigh.</p>
