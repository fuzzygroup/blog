<font size="+1"><b>Travel: Getting Ready to Be Away from Your PC for an Extended Trip</b></font>

IN 7 1/2 days (now 6 1/2) &nbsp;I leave for the first long trip I've taken in almost 4 years.&nbsp; What's worse is that I have had repeated laptop instability in recent months and a high degree of desktop crashes.&nbsp; And, this isn't pleasure, it's mostly work (more on that and why I'm visiting [Paolo](http://paolo.evectors.com/) in the next few days).&nbsp; So what do I do to get ready to be away from my PC for 8 days?&nbsp; How do I handle being away from my data?&nbsp; Well, the rest of this story focuses on exactly what I am doing.&nbsp; A lot of it is fairly basic.&nbsp; Some of it isn't and reflects a fairly geeky approach to computing since I can administer almost everything from anywhere in the world -- except for my home PC, of course where I have 99.9% of my data.

## Step 1: Backup

That's right.&nbsp; Backup all your data as painful as it is (and it will be painful).&nbsp; Do it now.&nbsp; At least 1 week before you go.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; If you wait, then it just won't get done.&nbsp; At least this way you can be sure that you are no more than 1 week out of backup.&nbsp;

## Step 2: Store the Backup Offsite

I actually know that you won't do this until just before you leave.&nbsp; I'm putting the thought in your head now so you can think about what "offsite" means.&nbsp; Here's a tip -- Your car is offsite by definition.&nbsp; I have a fireproof chest where my 160gb FireWire backup drive will be going while I am on the road.&nbsp; That chest will be going in the car.&nbsp;

## Step 3: Add Everyone In Your Inbox To Your Contacts Folder

There's no question that this one is painful.&nbsp; Agonizingly painful.&nbsp; Go into your Inbox.&nbsp; If you use Outlook then use Group messages by the Sender (a very cool feature) and then go through the entire Inbox and add everyone to your contact list.&nbsp; Yes it's a pain.&nbsp; It's very worth it since this brings us to Step 4.

## Step 4: Sync Your PDA With Your Contacts

If you don't have a Palm or other PDA then print out a paper list of every person, every domain name, every phone #, every cell phone # and every email address.&nbsp; Printing out a paper list is probably good anyway.

## Step 5: Burn Your My Documents Folder to a CD-R

&nbsp;

And what if your My Documents folder is larger than 640 mb?&nbsp;

## Step 6: Move MP3s onto Your Laptop

Step 7: Unsubscribe From All Mailing Lists

&nbsp;

Step 10: Backup

Step 11: Store the Backup Offsite
