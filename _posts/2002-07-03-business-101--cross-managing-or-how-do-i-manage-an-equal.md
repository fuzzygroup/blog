<font size="+1"><b>Business 101: Cross Managing or How do I manage an Equal?</b></font>

We've all heard of the idea of managing up i.e. when you manage your own boss.&nbsp; And then there's the normal concept of&nbsp;managing down when you manage people that report to you.&nbsp; This article introduces the idea of "cross managing" or managing people that are your equals, generally your business partner.&nbsp; So how do you manage an equal?&nbsp; Simple:

**You don't**.&nbsp;

Let me clarify.&nbsp; I'm actually not certain that, at least for really smart, people, that they are even manageable.&nbsp; And, when they are your equals, it's a lot harder.&nbsp; This essay talks about the issues and draws from two experiences of mine:

- My first partner, Brian in NTERGAID 
- My current partner, Gretchen, in The FuzzyGroup and our work with eVectors

Given my belief that partners need to be [equal](http://radio.weblogs.com/0103807/stories/2002/06/28/consulting101Partners.html), this is something that I have had quite a bit of experience with; perhaps these tips will be useful to someone.

## My Background

**NOTE:** If you are a long time reader, you probably know this and feel free to, quite joyously, skip ahead.

I've been managing people either my whole life, since I grew up as the boss' son in a [family corporation](http://www.byy.com/), or since I was 19 when I founded my first real company (actually my 2nd business) in 1987.&nbsp; That company, NTERGAID, we took from nothing, with no capital, to just under $1 million in sales and then sold it successfully to a publicly traded company in Cambridge, MA, Dataware.&nbsp; After that I failed at a startup and then joined a&nbsp; dot com, Mascot, worked my way up to VP of Engineering within 5 months and then left in abject and total disgust.&nbsp; Here are the numbers of staff that I have managed:

- NTERGAID - 15 by the end 
- Dataware - My team was about 25 people in size, 5 locations, 2 continents, at least 2 time zones.&nbsp; Less than fun.
- Mascot - Overall Company \> 175 at the end, my engineering group was between 35 and 45 depending on how you count consultants

So I have some background in management (and a degree in it) and people seem to [like](http://www.fuzzygroup.com/fanmail/#mascotscans) how I do things.&nbsp; But managing people who are subordinates, at least in a work context, is very, very different from managing people who are your equals.

## So... How Do You Manage an Equal?

The first thing to understand is that the very concept of "managing your equal" is just bizarre.&nbsp; Your equal shouldn't be managed.&nbsp; Perhaps **guided** is a better term.&nbsp; The way I look at it is that I report to Gretchen and she reports to me -- but do I manage her?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Not at all.&nbsp; She manages herself and I give input into the process.

So here's how I do it currently and have honed over 10 years of being in this situation:

1. **Respect Thy Partner**.&nbsp; In every single way possible.&nbsp; At all times.&nbsp; I mean this very seriously.&nbsp; The only way that equals can work together is by respecting each other.   
  
2. **Never Lose Your Temper**.&nbsp; When you come right down to it there just aren't a lot of things worth getting tremendously upset about -- and, when you do, it rarely, if ever, helps.   
  
3. **Apologize**.&nbsp; When you do, inevitably, lose your temper, apologize as soon as possible.   
  
4. **Let Them Make Their Own Decisions** --&nbsp;But Give Them All The Data.&nbsp; Here's an example -- we just had the July 4th holiday here in the states.&nbsp; Gretchen previously had plans but when something interesting, and potentially very significant, popped up at the last minute, I didn't tell her what to do.&nbsp; I didn't even ask her to skip her plans.&nbsp; I gave her the facts and let her make the decision (she chose to work).&nbsp; If it had been an absolute emergency then I probably would have asked; Not Required - asked.&nbsp; If your partner is a responsible person then they will almost always do the right thing when needed.&nbsp; If they aren't responsible then perhaps you have an issue.   
  
5. **Make All Information Public**.&nbsp; In my opinion, the single best way to manage a partner is very, very simple -- you make everything public.&nbsp; Here's another example -- I recently mentioned that I was rebuilding our internal task system.&nbsp; What I have been doing is moving everything off to the web so that we're not just stuffing things into Outlook or some other system where Person A can't see Person B's tasks.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Well, if everything is public then it's a lot easier for Person A to make their own decisions or "Oh I see that Gretchen has 40 tasks remaining for the BLN project.&nbsp; Maybe I ought to be more available so she can get those done since I'm down to 14".&nbsp;   
  
6. **Let Them Know Your Committment**.&nbsp; I'm not at all a fan of when someone keeps telling me "Oh I was working last night until midnight".&nbsp; When someone does it repeatedly, it always feels to me like they are blowing their own horn.&nbsp; I do believe, however, that you can do this in a more subtle fashion so that your partner knows how hard (or NOT hard) that you have been working.&nbsp; This is a really useful technique because it can set up a subtle competitive effect where Partner A tries to match Partner B.&nbsp; You should bear in mind, however, that people working an equal number of hours isn't necessarily required.&nbsp; People are different -- and they have different motivations at different times in their lives.&nbsp; Sometimes additional work is a very deliberate choice by one of the partners and it doesn't have to be matched.   
  
7. **Put it in Writing.&nbsp;&nbsp;** As anyone who has ever worked with me knows, I send lots of email.&nbsp; Lots.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because putting things in writing, if you can write even slightly well, tends to eliminate confusion.&nbsp; It also makes it so that people can go back to things (sure we all remember stuff -- often incorrectly).&nbsp; One of the nicest things about email is that it gives a record.&nbsp; And, one of the reasons why people love Outlook, warts, flaws, the RAM pig that it is, silly design choices and all, is Sent Items.&nbsp; By default Outlook never throws anything away.&nbsp; I have every email I've ever sent back to August of 1996.&nbsp; This has been invaluable more times than I can recount.&nbsp; I try never to do it in a "I told you so" sort of way, but in a "what did we agree on sort of way" or a "here's what we discussed way".   
  
8. **Talk**.&nbsp; Although at different times in my past I've been accused of being a poor communicator, this isn't the case in this context.&nbsp; I'm&nbsp;a firm believer in putting all issues out on the table and getting them addressed in real time or near real time.&nbsp; I try to never walk away angry or with something unresolved.&nbsp; Sure this can make some of the times we have an issue "talky".&nbsp; Big deal.&nbsp; This is part and parcel of what you need to do to "manage" a partner.

### Conclusion

I guess the summary of all this would be:

**You don't manage a partner.&nbsp;   
You set the circumstances up so that they can manage themselves with input from you.**
