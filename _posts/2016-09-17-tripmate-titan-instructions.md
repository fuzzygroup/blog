[Jeff, over at CodingHorror](https://blog.codinghorror.com/your-own-personal-wifi-storage/), recently turned me onto the TripMate Titan which is a tiny wifi hub which lets you plugin a USB stick that can be shared to your iPad.  This, coupled with the File Explorer app, lets your kid watch all of their programs without:

* having to sync them onto an iPad or Kindle
* having to have an iPad with lots of pricey storage
* having to have them all in the precise mp4 format that Apple has blessed - MKV?  AVI?  MOV?  No problem!

It is a $40 product you can get from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00RVIGY1I/?tag=fuzzygroup) and it is **brilliant**.  Best little hardware gadget I've bought in 2016 by far.

So I've bought one, compiled a USB stick of the kid's favorite shows and taken it away from home on vacation.  The only real issue that I've had is that using it takes a few discrete steps that last night, when I was exhausted, I bungled thus delaying watching by my boys.  Now Jeff's post, linked above, covers all of this in exhaustive detail.  What's listed below is the cliff notes version:

1.  Turn TripMate on by pressing center button and holding for 3 seconds.
2.  In wifi settings **connect** to the device; it will be labeled TripMateSith-xxx.  The password is **11111111** (8 ones).
3.  In File Explorer add a **windows share** if you don't have one already.  This needs to be an ip address of **10.10.10.254** with a username of **admin** and **NO PASSWORD**.
4.  Open the right folder and enjoy some form of media goodness.
5.  Turn it off by pressing and holding down for 3 seconds.

Note: You can use the built in admin tool to customize these settings and Jeff recommends it.  Me?  Eh.  I figured just write them down.

I can see all kinds of uses for this including putting movies from a family trip onto a USB stick to view via an iPad.  Recommended.
