<p align="left"><img align="left" alt="Too Many Options!" src="/assets/optionsmsword.jpg" /> Matt has his usual wonderful thoughts, this time on <a href="http://photomatt.net/2005/11/25/hidden-costs/#comments">options in software</a>. Having once sold a piece of software with roughly this many options (shown on left). Matt's right -- most people won't use the options and you can always expose a plugin api for it if you have to.</p>
<p align="left">Good job Matt! This was a gutsy post to write -- what Geek doesn't want features? Having big options dialogs makes you look like you have tons of features. And you do, just not usable ones. Its all about the 80 / 20 rule and clearly you understand that. And, while <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel</a> would argue that the 20 is always different, I don't buy that. While there always are differences, there are also commonalities that, if you take the time to understand your users, can be leveraged to everyone's advantage.</p>
