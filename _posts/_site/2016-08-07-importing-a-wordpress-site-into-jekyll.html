<p>Just a heads up if youâ€™re using Jekyll, <a href="https://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/wordpressdotcom/">WordPress import</a> does actually work but it is mildly tricky.  Install the jekyll-import gem and it will work bt ryou need to instal  a handfull of other gems for it to work.  This was first identified back in 2013 and its apparently still an <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-import/issues/58">issue</a>.  Once you work thru it though, I can confirm that it does work quite well.</p>
