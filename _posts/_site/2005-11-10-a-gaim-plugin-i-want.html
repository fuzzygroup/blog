<p>Ever typed in the wrong thing into the wrong IM window?  I'd love a <a href="http://gaim.sf.net/">Gaim</a> plugin which said "restrict any of these words to only these contacts".  Basically I'd love to be able to say to Gaim "I only want to curse at these people".  Chuckle.  Oh <a href="http://www.lazyweb.org/">Lazy Web</a> please save me.</p>
