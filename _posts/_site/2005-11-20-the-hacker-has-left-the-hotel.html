<p>Given that I've been holded up in Fresno for 2 nights now for Demitrious' wedding whilst concurrently hacking out the Feedster 500, and that all Feedster mail is down for me, this post is solely to let any fellow Feedsterites / Feedster contractors (over in Australia, this means <a href="http://airhead.typepad.com/">Mike</a> ...) that I'll be offline for 4 hours or so whilst I drive back back to San Francisco but I will have my cell phone if anyone needs me.</p>
<p>Podcasts that will be heard on said drive will include the Gilmor Gang and Adam Curry.</p>
