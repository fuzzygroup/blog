<p>I recently was traveling and off my trusty home machine and on a new laptop running Mavericks. And I found that when I worked on one of my applications (Hi Jim!), I was getting this error constantly:</p>

<p>Lost connection to MySQL server at ‘sending authentication information’, system error: 32</p>

<p>That’s not a good error. I dug into it and found this Stack Overflow post:</p>

<p>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17813630/mysql-5-6-headaches-on-mac-osx</p>

<p>And I dug into it and its the classic – OSX is Unix; except its not kind of crap. Sigh. And since MySQL 5.6 defaults to</p>

<p>innodb_file_per_table = ON</p>

<p>If you have any kind of a large mysql installation (and mine are huge) then you’re going to have issues. No way around it.  So here are the steps to fix it:</p>

<p>Create a my.cnf file in /etc.  All it needs is the following:
[mysqld]
innodb_file_per_table = OFF
Then reload mysql.  If you’re using home-brew then you need to do this:
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mysql.plist
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mysql.plist
And this is the worst part — dump your databases and reload.  I’m sorry.  There’s just no way around it.</p>
