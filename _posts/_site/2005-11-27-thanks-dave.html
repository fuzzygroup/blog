<p>I'm in the middle of, yafh*, working on improving the look and feel of Feedster's site.  I needed to know how to <a href="http://feedster.net/news_v7_pb_en.htm">wrap images around text</a>.  And, while I could have looked up on some HTML reference site, I did what I have done <strong>every single time</strong> I needed to know this since I started blogging.  I checked <a href="http://www.scripting.com/2005/11/25.html#When:12:42:42PM">Scripting</a>. Why? Well I always seem to remember "Dave Does this" and its always easy for me to find since I regularly read him. So thanks Dave!<br />
*<strong>Yet Another Feedster Hackathon</strong>; this time I arrived back from Thanksgiving by 7:30 pm, was eating Pizza by 8, bought a big screen flat panel by 9, crashed and rose again at 1:00 am to coordinate with <a href="http://airhead.typepad.com/">Mike</a> and grind on the new UI.</p>
