<p>Wow.&nbsp; I just spoke with my wife who's in the Dallas, Texas* area for Thanskgiving (I'm meeting her there) and her sister wanted to get Steve, her husband, an XBox 360 from the local Target.&nbsp; And, after arriving on line at 5 am, she discovered that there the store only had 12. <br />The local Walmart only had 48.&nbsp; And the biggest lot that anyone in the whole city had is reportedly 220 at the local Best Buy.</p>
<p>Looks like the reports of Microsoft limiting supply to maximize demand (and pricing) are completely true. </p>
<p>*That's where her family is.</p>
