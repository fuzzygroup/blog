<p>So I took the time to reload the data I described <a href="https://fuzzygroup.github.io/blog/2016/08/28/aws-tutorial-4-rds-data-loading-into-aurora-run-in-circles-scream-and-shout-the-oh-shite-moment.html">yesterday</a>, that we had fed into Aurora RDS, into a local MariaDB installation and I also eliminated split/cat from the equation by just using a file that had come straight from a mysql dump via an aws s3 sync operation and the results are disturbing:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Source db (vanilla mysql on our own hardware)
mysql&gt; select count(*) from a_big_table;
+----------+
| count(*) |
+----------+
|  2137447 |
+----------+

MariaDB on our own box
MariaDB [banks_production]&gt; select count(*) from a_big_table;
+----------+
| count(*) |
+----------+
|  2137447 |
+----------+

RDS (from loading same file):
select count(*) from a_big_table;
+----------+
| count(*) |
+----------+
|   797121 |
+----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Thatâ€™s not encouraging at all.</p>
