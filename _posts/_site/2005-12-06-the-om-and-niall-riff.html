<p>Ever hear a podcast that just called to you?&nbsp; So much so that you actually called up the Podcaster and said "Thanks Dude"?&nbsp; Well if not then I recommend you do so. What creative person doesn't enjoy getting thanked for their work?&nbsp; Well, for me last night (post SES sleep woes have made this now "last night") it was the <a href="http://onpodsessions.com/">Om and Niall show</a> from OnPodSessions.&nbsp; Part of it what was good for me was that the two of them just plain riffed on each other in a flavor akin to a Jazz improv session.&nbsp; Part of what was good for me is that it had an inherently high trust factor -- I know both <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/">Niall</a> and <a href="http://www.gigaom.com/">Om</a> fairly well (Niall more so; Om less so).&nbsp; Just as I inherently trust a Steve Gillmor podcast, I trust Niall and Om.
<p>Nice work guys.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>
