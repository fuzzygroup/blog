<p>Iâ€™ve been grinding since like 3:30 am, if you consider the post wedding drive from Fresno back to San Francisco; which I do since I came up with YMF500F* during the ride, so when one of the Feedster 500 Team Members, <a href="http://airhead.typepad.com/">Mike</a> our web contractor asked how I was felling, I got poetic:</p>
<p>(03:37:53) <strong>mikeair888:</strong> how you feeling?<br />
(03:38:46) <strong>fuzzygroup:</strong> i feel like hammered death on amphetamines after a 5 day crack binge</p>
