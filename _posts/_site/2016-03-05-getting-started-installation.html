<p>Well I’ve made the decision to start down the rabbit hole, once again, and learn something new.  I’ve decided to go for <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> as a language and <a href="http://www.phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix</a> as a web framework.  These nicely parallel the Ruby / Rails ecosystem which I’ve been full time in since 2007.  I’ll use this blog to capture the learning process.</p>
