<p>Heh.  I was leafing through my copy of the Pragmatic Programmer while taking my shower (what's that you say; you don't shower at 3 am?  Then you don't have an absolutely wonderful Australian web consultant like <a href="http://airhead.typepad.com/">Mike</a> that you're time synched with) and I found this little gem:</p>
<blockquote><p>find . -name '*.php' -mtime +7 -print | xargs grep 'v2db.php'</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah I know I should know it off the top of my head but I generally look these up until I memorize it.  And, if you think I'm blogging this because I **know** I'll need it again then please pass Go, collect $200 and get a Krispy Kreme.  Oh wait.  Here you go:</p>
