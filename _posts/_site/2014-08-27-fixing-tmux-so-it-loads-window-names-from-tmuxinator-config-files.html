<p>Dv hooked me on using Tmuxinator with iTerm 2 as a way of getting my rampant terminal usage under control and while it still makes me swear like a sailor from time to time, I found that if you add this to your ~/.tmux.conf file:</p>

<pre>
set-window-option -g allow-rename off
</pre>

<p>That tells Tmux to NOT allow the process that launches after the window is created to rename the window.  Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator/issues/141">jlipps</a> for asking the question.  Oddly enough, jlipps wrote the original version of <a href="http://www.appdata.com/">AppData</a> which I rewrote and now own with <a href="http://www.alloycode.com/">Jared</a>.  Small damn world.</p>
