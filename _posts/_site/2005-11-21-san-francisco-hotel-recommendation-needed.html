<p>As you may or may not know, I travel for Feedster to our San Francisco offices quite regularly.&nbsp; And the hotel I've been staying at, the Hotel Milano, has, ahem, connectivity woes:</p>
<p>Ping statistics for 64.95.116.11:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Packets: Sent = 102, Received = 67, Lost = 35 (34% loss),<br />Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minimum = 10ms, Maximum =&nbsp; 90ms, Average =&nbsp; 9ms</p>
<p>Now, just to be fair, this is with my 1 laptop on which WIFI actually works.&nbsp; So here's the criteria for a hotel recommendation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Close (walkable) to the Feedster Offices at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=116+New+Montgomery,+San+Francisco&amp;spn=0.024164,0.081376&amp;iwloc=A&amp;hl=en">116 New Montgomery</a></li>
<li>Connectivity either wired or wireless (preferable) that just plain works</li>
<li>Nothing monstrously expensive; one of the reasons that the Milano is attractive is that its not all that expensive ($140 / night) </li>
</ul>
<p>Any recommendations out there?</p>
