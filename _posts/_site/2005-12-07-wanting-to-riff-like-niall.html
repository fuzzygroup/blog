<p>So I'm seeing Niall and Om and "I wanna be like them".  Seriously though.  I'm definitely fascinated by podcasting, I've got the iPod 60 gig, and I feel that I'm ready to actually *gasp* create a podcast.  What occurs to me that might be interesting to the 13 people who read this blog is this : <strong>Tech War Stories</strong>.  I've been in technology for so damn long now and worked with so many characters that perhaps tossing out some of those stories like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every startup needs a green football</li>
<li>The day paul got a gun or "How to become a consultant in 1 easy step"</li>
<li>Real engineers can explain their code</li>
<li>Everyone needs a Geek Kit</li>
</ul>
<p>If this sounds interesting to you then leave a comment and I'll start working on it.  Most of my best stories are actually pre-Internet so that gives them an aura of "Aged Bits".</p>
<p>Oh and my 4.5 year old, Alex, has agreed to help.  He wants to be the Internet's youngest podcaster:</p>
