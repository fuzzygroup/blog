<p>Sigh.  Anyone who ever founded a company knows this scenario:</p>
<ol>
<li>You go to sleep.</li>
<li>You wake up *knowing* something is wrong.</li>
<li>You get on email and IM and, indeed, something is wrong.</li>
<li>You squash actions of less than perfect planning and thought that are doomed to cause you endless hours of future work and recovery.</li>
<li>You fume.</li>
<li>You rant.</li>
<li>You drop the issue and see refuge in a hot shower.   </li>
</ol>
<p> But to make it all better, I prescribe <a href="http://www.ihop.com/">International House of Pancakes</a> and <a href="http://drink.allrecipes.com/az/77768.asp">Vietnamese Iced Coffee</a> (make iced coffee, add sweetened condensed milk).  $happiness++;</p>
