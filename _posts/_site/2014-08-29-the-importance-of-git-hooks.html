<p>So I was working this morning and got one of those bloody awful Rails stack traces – every error was at the system layer and I could not make any progress debugging it.  So I looked at git status and there were like 25 + files all tied to an overall CSV import process (2 data models, 1 controller, system level UI changes, etc) and then it hit me – I need my .git hooks setup on this project!  Every bit of source code under management by git has a .git directory at the top level and under it a hooks directory.  Hooks are executable files that are run when you do an atomic level git action.  For example there is one called pre-commit and this is code that is executed BEFORE a commit actually happens.  What you can do with a pre-commit hook is tie in a code evaluation process (think lint if you’re a C guy) to find any errors before they are committed.  Now I’ve set these up in almost every project but not here so a quick copy of a file from another project to .git/hooks gave me this:</p>

<pre>
app/controllers/csv_imports_controller.rb:
8: syntax error, unexpected ')', expecting ']'
 @csv_import = current_user.csv_imports.find(params[:id))
 ^
24: syntax error, unexpected $end, expecting keyword_end
</pre>

<p>And here’s the offending line in question:</p>

<pre>
@csv_import = current_user.csv_imports.find(params[:id))
</pre>

<p>Yep.  params[:id]) was needed (second to last char was a ) instead of a ].  I looked at that line like 4 times and didn’t see it.</p>

<p>Having used these now for several years, its hard for me to imagine working in a dynamic language without them.  Kudos to Dv for setting these up once upon a time.</p>

<p>##.git/hooks for the win!</p>

<p>And here’s the code for .git/hooks/pre-commit  Adjust the shebang line accordingly and make sure its an executable file.</p>
