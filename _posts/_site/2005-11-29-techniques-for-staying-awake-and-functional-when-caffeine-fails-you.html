<p>Here are some tips when caffeine starts to either not work or, well, make you want to vomit rats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bright Light.  I've got a 300 watt halogen going in a 12 x 10 room and its having a noticable effect on my consciousness</li>
<li>Loud Music.  Hopefully my neighbors appreciate a Beastie Boys / Quiet Riot / Def Leopard / Dead Milkmen combination.</li>
<li>Cold.  I've got the window open and its chilly in here!  It works though.</li>
</ul>
