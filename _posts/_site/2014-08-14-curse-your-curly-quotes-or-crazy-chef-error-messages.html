<p>One of the reasons that I started blogging and continue to blog* is personal knowledge capture.  My own blog represents the knowledge that I gather during the course of my day to day work.  And that brings us to this crazy error message:</p>

<pre>
"chef" "ERROR: Encoding::CompatibilityError: incompatible character encodings: ASCII-8BIT and UTF-8"
</pre>

<p>I got this when I was running a single chef routine that I had documented here (see my last post on Chef):</p>

<pre>
bundle exec knife solo cook appdata@app1.pagedatapro.com -o 'server_setup::vim_configuration'
</pre>

<p>So I was pretty much certain that it worked.  Well it did.  But the representation in my blog was actually wrong â€“ the single quotes had been transposed to single curly quotes in either direction.  Oy!</p>

<p>*Albeit after a multi year hiatus that I regretted constantly and still regret.</p>
