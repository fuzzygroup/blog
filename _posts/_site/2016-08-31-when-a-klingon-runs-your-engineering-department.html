<p>This humor is company specific - I wrote it when I was at an Internet startup ages and ages ago.  It used to be better when I had actual customer names here but you get the gist.  The people at that company can probably understand best.  Its not bad as a piece of internal satire if you add your customer names into it.</p>

<ol reversed="reversed">
  <li>“<em>Insert Customer Name Here</em> is a piece of crap! They have no honor!”</li>
  <li>“Puny Terran, We will never fix that bug”</li>
  <li>“By nagging me with the launch date, you have questioned my family honor.  Prepare to die!”</li>
  <li>“You question the worthiness of my engineers.  Draw your batleft, I should kill you where you stand!”</li>
  <li>“<em>Insert Customer Name Here</em> is without honor!”</li>
  <li>“Answering your email is for the weak and timid!”</li>
  <li>“Your <em>Insert Customer Name Here</em> data is a piece of GAGH!”</li>
  <li>“Perhaps it <strong>IS</strong> a good day to Die!  I say we ship!”</li>
  <li>“<em>Insert Customer Name Here</em> has just dumped Stova Core!”</li>
  <li>“<em>Insert Obnoxious, Over Promising Salesperson Name Here</em> must die”</li>
</ol>
