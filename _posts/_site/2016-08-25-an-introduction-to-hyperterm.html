<p><a href="https://github.com/pickhardt/betty">Pickhardt / Betty</a> introduced me to the concept of <a href="https://hyperterm.org/">HyperTerm</a> and I have to admit that I was initially dismissive.  HyperTerm is a terminal built on top of Node and features web standards at the level of the terminal itself.  It has some interesting features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>url support - type in a url and press enter and it opens in the terminal.  Damn.  Impressive.  Weird.  Impressive.</li>
  <li>better colors - yes it is minor but surprisingly pleasant</li>
  <li>better sounds - again minor but very nice.</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s also some bad:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sluggish - clicking on a terminal tab just groans with slowness.</li>
  <li>it doesn’t go far enough - if this is ever going to succeed then it needs to do more than the hat trick of opening google in the terminal; it needs to be composable, pipeable, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>A solid discussion of HyperTerm can be found on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12102100">Hacker News</a>.</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>Installation is a bit tedious so here are all the steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>brew update</li>
  <li>brew tap caskroom/cask</li>
  <li>brew cask update</li>
  <li>brew cask install hyperterm</li>
</ul>

<p>Very, very interesting.  I’ve used it on and off all day long and for an early release piece of open source, it has been <em>pleasant to use</em>.  That’s a decent statement to make abouti</p>
