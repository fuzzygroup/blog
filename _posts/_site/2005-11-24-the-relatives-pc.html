<p>So I'm off in Texas in some suburb of Dallas, spending Turkey day with Shelley's family.  And, naturally, I have to login and deal with issues of <a href="http://top500.feedster.com/">Top 500</a> <a href="http://scott.feedster.com/?p=17">tag spam</a>, a new bug that cropped up, etc.  So I go over to Shelley's Dad's PC and type into the Run command "Putty".  And it works.   Clearly I've been on this PC before.</p>
<p>(Putty is a SSH client that I use religiously for logging into Feedster servers).</p>
