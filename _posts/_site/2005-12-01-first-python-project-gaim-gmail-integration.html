<p>I thought a lot about 1st projects to learn Python and, well, my first idea was overly ambitious.  So I thought more about computing problems I have every single day and one came to me: Gaim IM Logs, well, suck.  I mean the log format is fine but the search is deadly slow I often need access to them when I'm not at the machine where the log was created.  So why not write a Python app that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Runs as a service in the background.</li>
<li>Monitors the Gaim log directory structure</li>
<li>When it finds a new log file upload it to gmail adding whatever metadata it can find to make it better searchable</li>
<li>Extract all embedded urls from the IM logs (hey I'm processing them anyway) to a local "IM Catalog", time sorted newest at the top -- how often do you need a url someone sent you and you can't remember exactly who or which account you had but you'd know it if you saw it.  This is a feature I had in my late, lamented only by me, Inbox Buddy product and it rocked.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you think about it, this project covers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Overall application structure</li>
<li>Application configuration since you need to know where to look to find the user's specific IM logs, their gmail account name, mail server, etc</li>
<li>Data parsing</li>
<li>Network IO in the form of mail sending</li>
<li>HTML generation</li>
</ol>
<p>That's a lot of the basic primitives I use every single day in PHP.  It'll be interesting to see how Python compares.</p>
<p>Step 1 - a basic recursive directory scanner looking for log files.</p>
