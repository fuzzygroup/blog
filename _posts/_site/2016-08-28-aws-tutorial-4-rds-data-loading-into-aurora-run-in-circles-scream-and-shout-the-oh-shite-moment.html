<p>If you’ve read tutorial <a href="https://fuzzygroup.github.io/blog/2016/08/23/aws-exporting-a-large-mysql-instance-to-aws.html">1</a>, <a href="https://fuzzygroup.github.io/blog/2016/08/24/aws-tutorial-2-importing-a-large-mysql-instance-from-s3.html">2</a> or <a href="https://fuzzygroup.github.io/blog/2016/08/28/aws-tutorial-3-notes-on-s3-sync.html">3</a> then you absolutely need to read this one.</p>

<p>What I’ve been doing is generating mysqldump load files on a normal MySQL instance and then feeding them into an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/">Amazon RDS</a> hosted Aurora db.  Normally I’m beyond conservative with the storage layer of anything I build but this time I went for the gusto and used something new - <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/">Amazon Aurora</a>.</p>

<p>What I’ve just discovered is terribly, terribly troubling.  I’m encountering silent load failures where data I’ve exported is in the dump files but NOT in Aurora after the load.  I discovered this one time thru an error message and other than that I haven’t seen an error message but I am missing data.</p>

<p>Now given the convoluted gyrations with split, sync and cat to recombine, it would be easy to assume that the issue is mine but I only used split / cat on two tables of data and there are issues with at least 3 tables so one of the tables did NOT use split / cat.  Here’s an example:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>source:
select count(*) from large_table;
+----------+
| count(*) |
+----------+
| 72994268 |
+----------+
1 row in set (1 min 28.98 sec)

aurora:
select count(*) from large_table;
+----------+
| count(*) |
+----------+
| 43012074 |
+----------+
1 row in set (30.66 sec)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>And this was one of the non split files.  The files done with split are worse.</p>

<p>I have an ec2 instance configured as a high performance db server so I’m loading one of the offending files into to see if I can eliminate Aurora as the issue.</p>

<p>And I’m not going to definitely say that the issue is Aurora.  I’ve prematurely pointed the finger in the past and that’s not fair.  What I do think is fair is to say the following:
* Do not assume that because an import succeeded that all your data is there
* Absolutely verify row counts from source to destination
* I don’t know that row counts indicate success; I think you need a checksum of sql statements from source to destination but that’s a much harder problem</p>

<p>More later if / when I understand this.</p>
