<p>Its time to become a P^3 person.  I mean I know Perl, I know PHP.  Why not *drum roll* Python?</p>

</ol>
<p>Heh. Feels good to be geeky again. P^3 is the goal I say, P^3. Hm... Given that in another age I did prolog can that make me already P^3 or does code you last wrote in 1987 not count anymore ?</p>
