If you know me as a developer then you know that I'm, well, text centric.  I'm a back end guy living in a front end world so to speak and I lack, ahem, **any graphical skills whatsoever**.  To this day my favorite graphic tools are:

* Deluxe Paint under Dos
* JASC's Paint Shop Pro 5

And you can count on the fingers of 2 hands the number of edited screenshots / png files that I've made personally since about 1996 when those tools passed from this computing world.  *sniff; alas*  

Anyway, I've been re-doing my personal tool stack recently and I thought it might be interesting to document the process hence this post and subsequent add on posts.  My first choice for "Software Worth Purchasing" is [Flying Meat Software's Acorn 5.5](http://www.flyingmeat.com/acorn/).  They describe it as a "Image Editor for Humans" and I can attest to that:

* I'm human
* I can use it

I'm graphically challenged at best and when I was able to use it add basic, albeit bad looking, arrows to my latest [aws tutorial](https://fuzzygroup.github.io/blog/aws/2016/09/11/aws-tutorial-07-understanding-elastic-ips.html), I was delighted.  Its very possible that there is a nice arrows feature inside the product but the fact that I was able to open an image and make basic changes without worrying about layers, crazy file formats, wondering where the damn scroll bars went*.

I think the best commentary I can make about this is **it works like Mac software is supposed to work**.  In the process of writing this I had to modify the image below to remove my serial number and even though I am graphically challenged I was still able to:

* remove a region of the image
* find the dropper
* get the right color
* zoom in
* fill in the region
* save it

And they have that level of quintessential grace and style that a small, independent Mac company is supposed to have:

I cannot say how delighted I am with Acorn.  Utterly, massively recommended!


*That one's a commentary about [Sketch](https://sketchapp.com) which is a brilliant product seemingly but where the hell did the scrollbars go - how am I supposed to intuit how to pan around a large virtual workspace???
