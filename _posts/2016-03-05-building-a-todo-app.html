<p>As a first real learning experience I took the time to work thru the <a href="https://resolve.digital/blog/posts/creating-a-todo-application-using-the-phoenix-framework-and-ember-js/">Resolve Digital Todo App</a> and I have to admit that I was impressed.  Overall this tutorial was spot on.  The only changes I had to make to it were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adapt it from using postgres to mysql which, honestly, was nothing more than adding “—database mysql” to the initial create statement:</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin:0;font-size:11px;font-family:Menlo;">mix phoenix.new phoenix_todos_api --no-brunch  --database mysql</p>
<ul>
<li>At the ember level, I had to adjust the version number of the ember-cli-shims (in the file bower.json):</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin:0;font-size:11px;font-family:Menlo;">"ember-cli-shims": "ember-cli/ember-cli-shims#0.1.0”, </p>
<p style="margin:0;font-size:11px;font-family:Menlo;"> </p>
