So my new gig has moved to doing daily agile standup meetings and while I've done these before, I don't think I've ever seen them done quite so consistently well.  And the credit for this goes to my boss, Dave Sifry, who is our lead facilitator.  We are a team of 8 people and, so far, we have brought them in at under the scheduled 15 minutes per meeting every time.  

Here are the techniques that we are using:

1. **Start on time**.  If everyone isn't there, well, the meeting happens anyway.  Ideally, if the team lead isn't on time, the meeting happens anyway.
2. **Scheduled for 5 minutes after the hour**.  This allows people in other meetings to make it.
3. **A consistent Url**.  This is the one down side to Zoom - the meeting can't start if the leader isn't present.  If we used Google Meet then that wouldn't be an issue.
4. **A simple format**.  A ridiculously simple, fast format:

* Here's what I'm up to today
* Here's what I'm stuck on.
* How can I help anyone else?

While I'm generally not a fan of meetings, agile stand ups, done this way, tend to bring developers into line.  Even if a developer isn't good with email - or good with text messages - normally they can handle "show up at time X for 15 minutes every day".  

In closing, while I'm not a huge proponent of [heavy weight agile processes (think scrum / agile velocity)](https://fuzzyblog.io/blog/software_engineering/2019/06/28/understanding-a-small-organization-s-agile-model.html), I am really enjoying daily stand ups again.  Recommended.
