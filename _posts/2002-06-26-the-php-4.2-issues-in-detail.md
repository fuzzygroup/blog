<font size="+1"><b>The PHP 4.2 Issues In Detail</b></font>

All,

As I noted in an earlier blog entry, I got what I feel is HOSED (that's not good) by the 4.2 release of PHP when my ISP installed it today.&nbsp; Maxim, my editor in chief at [www.phpbeginner.com](http://www.phpbeginner.com),&nbsp;was technically savvy enough&nbsp;to attempt to make this acceptable to me.&nbsp; And he did a great job.&nbsp; But you'll see my final response at the end.&nbsp;

I'd also like to really, really thank Guy K. Haas who was nice&nbsp;enough to both edit this document and confirm that I'm not nuts (at least to him, or we're both nuts).&nbsp; Guy has a history of working at the ANSI standards level for&nbsp;programming languages so it's fair to say that he more than understands this.&nbsp;

Note -- This one is real geeky although at least one of the fundamental issues at hand is economic.

-- Scott

> <p>Scott, let me explain you why these people at PHP Dev had to do so. (I</p>
> <p>have also protested for the first time as I heard of it).</p>
> <p>First, there will be no 5.0 - that is what Zeev personally have told me</p>
> <p>some year ago on a meeting. Though, I have also heard the rumors/plans</p>
> <p>of a work starting up on the skeleton 5.0. But see, and even if PHP 5</p>
> <p>comes up, its major changes will be the parser and loads of new and</p>
> <p>revised modules.</p>
> <p>PHP 4 Parser is already good and with few bugs, however no one thinks it</p>
> <p>should not be done better, more complex and flexible. And this is the</p>
> <p>performance issue. To change the parser (and compiler) the market should</p>
> <p>have a stronger HW. However, that is going to happen considering that</p>
> <p>PHP 4 was written 2 years ago. In fact, you might have heard Zend</p>
> <p>working on the Engine 2 (marketing again?).</p>
> <p>Another reason is Apache 2 which is still far from being called stable.</p>
> <p>This makes it impossible for PHP to make a stable Apache 2 module since</p>
> <p>right now Apache 2 changes dramatically, jumping between alpha and beta</p>
> <p>releases. This will continue for at least a few more months.</p>
> <p>In other words, PHP 5.0, if ever released, would have its own</p>
> <p>compatibility problems.</p>
> <p> </p>
> <p>Second problem is the security.</p>
> <p>Too many people have complained about the security vulnerability. Soon</p>
> <p>afterwards, the press started to look down at PHP downgrading it in the</p>
> <p>reviews with the excuse that the most popular programming language is</p>
> <p>also the most insecure when in hands of those who "learn it real quick".</p>
> <p>&gt;From e-business point of view this meant the disaster.</p>
> <p>PHP 4.1 was releases with such fix. This in fact wasn't a fix but rather</p>
> <p>was a forced incompatibility. It was the first time for PHP to change</p>
> <p>the middle digit and was not usual. Magic Quotes were still default. And</p>
> <p>here, rumors got even higher mentioning that even PHP Dev Group admitted</p>
> <p>PHP being insecure. So, what they did was, month after 4.1.x release,</p>
> <p>4.2 was out with MQ set to OFF by default.</p>
> <p>I personally think this was way too quick for such major change, but I</p>
> <p>do agree it was a must. From both - security and marketing points of</p>
> <p>view. True, security is a transparent value, a programmer makes the</p>
> <p>application secure, not the language... But too many newbies are out</p>
> <p>there learning this still. Such feature, unfortunately, had to be</p>
> <p>disabled by default. Yet, never so quickly and unexpectedly. That is how</p>
> <p>I think.</p>
> <p>Documentation Team also didn't do well documenting this, mentioning it</p>
> <p>so alarming that everyone who downloads a new version knows that MOST</p>
> <p>(not all, but most because there are also lots of Open Source apps that</p>
> <p>rely on such feature) will get screwed up.</p>
> <p>That is as far as I personally know and understand this whole thing. As</p>
> <p>I said, I also got very frustrated hearing it for he first time, but if</p>
> <p>you look deeper into the problem you will find that there were too few</p>
> <p>better ways to make this major change.</p>

> <p>* Move backwards in version #. (My response.)</p>
> <p>* Override this option so it works like it did before.</p>

> <p>it's in our best interest then you're dreaming.</p>
> <p> </p>
> <p><strong>[From Guy K. Haas: I was on the COBOL committee when they tried to get some changes into the</strong></p>
> <p><strong>standard that would have allowed compilers to be delivered that would</strong></p>
> <p><strong>disallow statements that had worked for 15 years because they had realized that</strong></p>
> <p><strong>certain elements of the language had been categorized in the "wrong" division of the</strong></p>
> <p><strong>program back then, and now should be in a different division. The THEORY</strong></p>
> <p><strong>was that compilers would first report the old-style usage and alert customers </strong></p>
> <p><strong>to change it. But the next release of the compilers could just honor the</strong></p>
> <p><strong>new way and make the old way an error and the entire insurance industry</strong></p>
> <p><strong>erupted.]</strong></p>
> <p>Case in point: Have you fixed every single script on www.phpbeginner.com and</p>
> <p>at your day job? I'll buy you dinner next month in Venice if you have and</p>
> <p>we actually get together.</p>
> <p>Your arguments are cogent and technically valid. That doesn't mean they are</p>
> <p>correct. According to a partial directory list of my website archive I have</p>
> <p>1,683 PHP scripts totaling 10,629,639 bytes. Assuming 1/2 hour to review</p>
> <p>every script that's 841.5 hours of work. At my serious development rate of</p>
> <p>$110 per hour that's a $92,565 cost item. And I'm one little guy with not</p>
> <p>all that much code. A technically correct argument that is not economically </p>
> <p>viable will basically fail every time. Anyone on the PHP team look at it that way?</p>

## From Maxim to Scott:
> <font size="2"><font size="2">
> <p>See, Scott, soon or later this had to happen. Even today, there are some</p>
> <p>people left running PHP 3. If turning magic quotes to off now breaks 70%</p>
> <p>of PHP apps then one year later it would still be braking 30-40%. If you</p>
> <p>talk about a complete compatibility then this would not happen anyway,</p>
> <p>now or tomorrow.</p>
> <p>The whole job in this was the documentation for the change. I wish there</p>

> <p>reading the docs saying: "new releases are always compatible...".</p>
> <p>Would this decision be mine, I would do everything to let users know,</p>

> <p>See: <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.variables.php">http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.variables.php</a>.</p>
> <p>That was the real problem of this change - not giving enough time to</p>
> <p>prepare the users for it.</p>
> <p>I fixed PHP Beginner by simply turning back Magic Quotes to ON in the</p>
> <p>php.ini file and by adding the patch (see the link) to my global</p>

> <p>True, I will lose the dinner because I will not have the perfect code</p>
