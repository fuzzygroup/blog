_Marketing 101. Consulting 101. PHP Consulting. Random geeky stuff. I Blog Therefore I Am._

<font size="+1"><b>An Open Source Evangelist Explains Open Source</b></font>

My background is in commercial software development in a propietary environment.&nbsp; Despite this background I have become a passionate advocate for Open Source in general.&nbsp; There are a number of reasons for this, each of which are detailed below.&nbsp; This document, written as a set of questions and answers, evolved from a chat session with the creator [www.marketingconspiracy.com](http://www.marketingconspiracy.com) as I tried to explain to him what this is all about.

&nbsp;

travisdu: Scott...you around?  
fuzzygroup: I will be in about 20 minutes. Just awoke. tty after shower and caffeine hit of the morning.  
travisdu: ok  
travisdu: morning  
fuzzygroup: Morning  
travisdu:   
travisdu: bleary eyed?  
fuzzygroup: The vb code -- how did you actually create it ? And what windows version is it for ?  
travisdu: lol....XP......  
travisdu: via a piece of software called...  
fuzzygroup: Ah.   
fuzzygroup: WinBatch ?  
travisdu: macro scheduler  
fuzzygroup: ok. Sec for more on that.   
travisdu: im begining to realize that....  
travisdu: using a software instead of knowing the base language limits my ability to....  
fuzzygroup: Yup  
travisdu: correctly create what i want and impliment it.  
fuzzygroup: Yup.  
travisdu:   
fuzzygroup: If it's php you want to learn   
travisdu: lol  
fuzzygroup: then I can help a lot  
fuzzygroup: since I'm training my partner already.  
travisdu: php i may end up looking at yes....since  
travisdu: that seems to be the consensus best and..  
travisdu: agile.  
fuzzygroup: Well.  
fuzzygroup: Let me make a suggestion.  
travisdu: ok  
fuzzygroup: Why don't you tell me what you want to do  
fuzzygroup: and then lets see if php is the right language  
fuzzygroup: i.e. match the investment to the problem so to speak  
travisdu: lol ok....i think its not worth the effort, like hitting a mouse with a sledgehammer when a trap would do fine.  
travisdu: im playing with start page exchanges is all.  
fuzzygroup: do you know the url to the scripting tool so i can look up a few things ?  
fuzzygroup: Ok  
fuzzygroup: So basically you want to customize your web sites ?  
fuzzygroup: (note -- I'll make a blog entry out of this most likely)  
travisdu: no no....do you know what a start page exchange is?  
travisdu: thats fine.  
fuzzygroup: no i guess not  
travisdu: [www.startblaze.com](http://www.startblaze.com)  
travisdu: when you start up your browser...  
travisdu: you have a predefined start page.  
fuzzygroup: ok  
travisdu: any way these exchanges have poped up around this principle.....  
fuzzygroup: ah.  
fuzzygroup: want an off the cuff comment based on looking at this very quickly ?  
travisdu: shoot  
fuzzygroup: What this seems to be about is a "easy" way to get trafffic.  
fuzzygroup: When I was a vp of engineering at a dot com  
fuzzygroup: our ceo wanted this type of stuff desperately  
fuzzygroup: I'm not certain that it's possible.  
travisdu: correct.....a very poor quality form of traffic....  
travisdu: they are quite successfull so far but the traffic they attract is of....  
travisdu: fairly dismal quality.  
fuzzygroup: Really ?  
fuzzygroup: Yup.  
travisdu: the thing is that they have been so successfull.....  
fuzzygroup: question  
travisdu: sure.  
fuzzygroup: How do you know they are successful?  
fuzzygroup: (little known but true - the dot coms faked traffic all the time)  
travisdu: The number of webmasters that are using the exchanges numbers in the hundreds of thousands.  
travisdu: [www.startblaze.com](http://www.startblaze.com) is in the top 100 on Alexa  
fuzzygroup: ok. but how do you know that ? Ah.  
fuzzygroup: Hmmmm  
fuzzygroup: i tend to be very cyncial on this stuff.  
travisdu: i am as well....  
fuzzygroup: It strikes me that blogging gets you more traffic and of more qualit  
fuzzygroup: y but the committment has to be there.  
travisdu: in fact i would say they are almost worthless...  
fuzzygroup: i.e. you need to make a blog and make it daily.  
travisdu: i agree....  
travisdu: I set up some of these exchanges for one of my pages....  
fuzzygroup: So, if it was me, I'd reorient my web marketing around a blog and see what happens  
travisdu: and am getting about 400 uniques a day...  
fuzzygroup: Ah. Interesting.  
travisdu: the thing is that....  
travisdu: each person viewing my page....  
fuzzygroup: Do you know the duration of traffic i.e.  
fuzzygroup: do they ever go deeper from the home page ?  
travisdu: only stays for a very short time....  
travisdu: hold on let me get this out...  
fuzzygroup: Ah.  
travisdu: so what is happening is that....  
fuzzygroup: Have you reverse dns'd the traffic ever ?  
fuzzygroup: sec  
travisdu: the exchanges are becoming about as worthwhile as your average persons spam.  
travisdu: k  
fuzzygroup: Ah.   
travisdu: im going to give you an url that will show you what i mean visually.  
travisdu: [http://www.fastfreeway.com/start.php3?num=71670](http://www.fastfreeway.com/start.php3?num=71670)  
travisdu: this should make it obvious  
travisdu: the top frame controls the display of the bottom frame as well as giving a certian time period for viewing.  
travisdu: most pages are for webmaster "opportunities" related to biz ops and such.  
fuzzygroup: Ah.   
travisdu: In any case ive been working on some....  
fuzzygroup: Ok. Before I forget I need the url for Macro Scheduler.  
travisdu: ahh ok....  
travisdu: [www.mjtnet.com](http://www.mjtnet.com)  
fuzzygroup: Ok. I need to go offline for a bit and focus on thsi. You around in an hour or so ?  
travisdu: yeah ill be around....  
travisdu: by the way...  
travisdu: I just found a site that blows me away....  
travisdu: mind you i have a really high bull meter.  
travisdu: [www.marketingexperiments.com](http://www.marketingexperiments.com)  
travisdu: so i dont say that often.  
travisdu: ill be around.  
fuzzygroup: k. ttyl.  
travisdu: politically incorrect website idea......www.nakedhomeless. com  
fuzzygroup: cool.   
travisdu: what do you think? should i run with it?   
fuzzygroup: why not ?  
travisdu: lol...sorry my brain wanders at these hours.  
fuzzygroup: whose doesn't ?  
fuzzygroup: i mean do you know htat I've seen every sunrise in like 5 months now ?  
travisdu: you sound like that guy Warthom or whatever his name is.  
travisdu: the guy who created Mathimatica.  
fuzzygroup: lol. no he's smart. i'm just driven.  
fuzzygroup: or nuts. take your pick.  
travisdu: i dont like to pick my nuts.  
fuzzygroup: lol. roflol.  
travisdu: anyway...im giving  
travisdu: drupal a second look at the moment.  
fuzzygroup: good.   
fuzzygroup: i tend to not push anything unless i have done a lot of looking at it.  
travisdu: success and frustration rolled into one package.  
fuzzygroup: and if you want me to just   
fuzzygroup: stuff an instance on my server for you  
fuzzygroup: that's easy  
fuzzygroup: eliminates the frustration  
travisdu: nah i got it running.  
fuzzygroup: ok. just offering.  
travisdu: [www.travisweb.com/index.php](http://www.travisweb.com/index.php)  
travisdu: appreciate it.  
fuzzygroup: it looks like i'll be helping get this going for a national blog community (still in negotiations)  
travisdu: i cant get the blocks to display on the left   
fuzzygroup: so the docs and themese will get a big boost  
travisdu: oh that would be cool  
fuzzygroup: Yup.  
travisdu: what do you mean by a national bloggin community?  
fuzzygroup: Think about a blogging community in a foreign country   
travisdu: Ahh ic.  
fuzzygroup: (asian) can't say more yet.  
travisdu: no worries.....  
fuzzygroup: do you need a theme with blocks oon the left ?  
travisdu: why is it that most CMS are built in Europe?  
fuzzygroup: lol.  
fuzzygroup: there are a lot of reasons for that  
travisdu: LOL thats why it wont display on the left?  
travisdu: doh  
fuzzygroup: but it would be insulting to the europeans for me to go there  
travisdu: so?  
travisdu:   
travisdu: just playing  
travisdu: im german decent  
fuzzygroup: I need to politely find a way to say "99% of europeans are control freaks"  
fuzzygroup: and cms is about control  
travisdu: you mean a "marketing friendly" way to imply that lol  
travisdu: ahh i get ya  
fuzzygroup: but, never forget that the cms that make real $$$ are us  
travisdu: US companies u mean?  
fuzzygroup: Yup  
travisdu: Can you recommend a theme for me?  
travisdu: i guess i could just download them all  
travisdu: but i dont know which ones work for the new version  
fuzzygroup: give me a bit of time and i'll find one for you.  
travisdu: nah no worries.....  
travisdu: i dont like to waste peoples time with stuff i can do myself.  
fuzzygroup: dpmt  
travisdu: i try not to be lazy.  
fuzzygroup: don't worry about it.  
fuzzygroup: i have to do one for gretchen's site anyway.  
travisdu: so from looking at it...drupal....  
travisdu: all the theme editing is done offline right?  
travisdu: i mean there is no interface.  
travisdu: correct?  
fuzzygroup: That's basically correct  
fuzzygroup: themes are definited in a code file.  
travisdu: or i should say admin display of the areas to edit.  
travisdu: right  
travisdu: is anyone doing marketing for Drupal?  
fuzzygroup: me  
fuzzygroup: i own [www.drupalhosting.com](http://www.drupalhosting.com) (nothing there yet)  
travisdu: Ill be honest with you i dont understand Open Source theology.  
fuzzygroup: ask away  
travisdu: Well if i understand it right...OP is based on...  
travisdu: the idea that if you build it, they will nead service correct?  
fuzzygroup: not really at all.  
travisdu: lol ok  
travisdu: how do they make money?  
fuzzygroup: Well. back up a bit.  
travisdu: ok  
fuzzygroup: The basic premise here is that OS is about "freedom"  
fuzzygroup: i.e the ability to control your own data and computing resources  
fuzzygroup: it's called "free as in beer"  
fuzzygroup: ie beer isn't free but you are free to do with it what you want  
travisdu: ok but they dont charge for the beer?  
fuzzygroup: Yes.  
fuzzygroup: So, for example, Red Hat can charge for the services around Linux but not for Linux itself  
travisdu: including the additions they have made to it.  
fuzzygroup: Yup.  
travisdu: hmmm....  
fuzzygroup: So what you pay for when you buy red hat is NOT the code but the packaging, the support contract, etc.  
travisdu: how does that protect Red Hat  
fuzzygroup: protect them from what ?  
travisdu: competition.  
fuzzygroup: Well  
fuzzygroup: it doesn't really but it also does  
fuzzygroup: for example [www.mandrake.com](http://www.mandrake.com) was origianlly a clone of Redhat right down to everything  
travisdu: ok   
travisdu: and?  
fuzzygroup: Well  
fuzzygroup: if you want to be successful you need to differentiate yourself (essensce of makreting)  
fuzzygroup: marketing that is  
travisdu: ic ic  
travisdu: ok here is the problem i have with OS...  
fuzzygroup: so what this all comes down to is that a bunch of geeks  
fuzzygroup: find a cool problem  
fuzzygroup: write some code  
fuzzygroup: if it gets up steam  
fuzzygroup: then others coalesce around it  
fuzzygroup: and then offer whatever else needs to be done (docs, etc)  
fuzzygroup: and, while its not perfect, there is one thing that everyone misses about it.  
travisdu: yes?  
fuzzygroup: A good OS product is substantially higher in quality than a commercial product.  
travisdu: example?  
travisdu:   
fuzzygroup: Well.  
fuzzygroup: Linux for example.  
fuzzygroup: Note quality is a fuzzy metric  
fuzzygroup: I would define it as "Software that don't crash"  
fuzzygroup: not as in "perfect docs"  
travisdu: ok ill give ya that one.   
fuzzygroup: Another example: Drupal.  
fuzzygroup: Ever see my performance analysis on drupal ?  
travisdu: Not ready for public consumption though.  
fuzzygroup: Disagree.  
travisdu: the average netizen can not use this.  
fuzzygroup: it's ready for their target market.  
fuzzygroup: And that's a geeky sort.  
fuzzygroup: It's not yet you.  
travisdu: hmmm ic i agree.  
travisdu: so they are going after....  
fuzzygroup: Here's another example  
fuzzygroup: QMail is an awesome mail server  
travisdu: the implimenter.  
fuzzygroup: They lack marketing in a formal sense you have to understand.  
fuzzygroup: So their target is really folks like themselves - geeky people that want to do cool web stuff.  
travisdu: right...  
travisdu: yeah its ready for them.  
fuzzygroup: Yes it is.   
fuzzygroup: And Linux on the Desktop really isn't there yet.  
travisdu: Here is my prob with open source personally.....  
travisdu: If i create a business.....  
fuzzygroup: But I would point out that our current high tech products all pretty much suck rocks today.  
travisdu: I want to be able to build into it the ability to build me out of it.  
fuzzygroup: Ah...  
travisdu: why would i want to create a service business.  
fuzzygroup: Well here is how this is generally done  
travisdu: i hate customer service.  
travisdu: hey Scott can you hold that thought...  
fuzzygroup: sure  
travisdu: i need to pee and smoke....  
travisdu: back in 5   
fuzzygroup: ok. ttyl.  
travisdu: k ditto  
travisdu: being able to pee and smoke is a decidedly male pleasure.  
travisdu: at the same time i mean.  
travisdu:   
fuzzygroup: lol. Yes.   
travisdu: ok here is my marketing plan for Drupal.....  
travisdu: give away the software.....  
travisdu: and sell easy to understand docs!!   
fuzzygroup: Sure. Nothing is stopping you from just doing that.  
travisdu: haha  
fuzzygroup: no seriously.  
fuzzygroup: One thing that people generally find bizarre  
travisdu: actually they should sell the modules.....ala Red Hat  
fuzzygroup: Red Hat doesn't sell modules, what do you mean ?  
travisdu: hmm...I thought Red Hat sold the....  
travisdu: package and docs and such.  
travisdu: basically their versioning.  
travisdu: addons and such.  
fuzzygroup: kind of.  
fuzzygroup: what they really sell is a box with a licnese to call for support  
travisdu: See thats my main prob with OS...let me explain with an example from my own biz.  
travisdu: The information I sold I could have easily given away....  
fuzzygroup: Sure  
fuzzygroup: and I think i know where you are going  
fuzzygroup: Yes it could have been given away.  
travisdu: the problem is that i have no desire to be a consultant  
fuzzygroup: But actually no.  
travisdu: there is no leverage in that.  
fuzzygroup: And I disagree  
fuzzygroup: Example.  
fuzzygroup: You create a book about Drupal.  
fuzzygroup: That book has a copyright that you own  
fuzzygroup: And you cna do with it what you like.  
travisdu: and Drupal org gets no piece?  
fuzzygroup: Nope!  
fuzzygroup: why would they ?  
travisdu: poopie for drupal.  
fuzzygroup: You did the work.  
fuzzygroup: Hmmm  
fuzzygroup: i think i'm miscommunicating something here.  
travisdu: I guess im trying to make parallels....  
fuzzygroup: Bear in mind that it's really not about $$$ in the OS world.  
travisdu: to different products.  
fuzzygroup: It's about "freedom".   
fuzzygroup: The $$$ happen as a consequence of the freedom to make a better product  
fuzzygroup: Yeah. It's communistic as hell.  
travisdu: The only corralary i see is to the tipping model that some ...  
fuzzygroup: But in the end -- what people buy is trust.  
travisdu: are using with success.  
fuzzygroup: For example, I'm a happy Red Hat customer for my server  
fuzzygroup: since I know it basically works.  
fuzzygroup: So i have (thru my ISP) a support contract  
travisdu: hmm ic interesting.  
fuzzygroup: Now lets go somewhere new  
fuzzygroup: Let's say that you want to make some custom changes to Drupal to drive your business  
travisdu: ok  
fuzzygroup: You can do them yourself or hire (example) me to do them.  
fuzzygroup: Legally I have to contribute them back to the overall project  
fuzzygroup: Now the dupal guys may take them, reject them or whatever  
fuzzygroup: but the legal issue with the GPL license model   
fuzzygroup: is that you have to give back (under certain criteria)  
fuzzygroup: other licenses are different  
travisdu: Hmm ic  
fuzzygroup: now think about this.  
travisdu: I like that.  
fuzzygroup: Yes you end up helping someone else   
fuzzygroup: by this   
fuzzygroup: but you also could have spent hundreds of grand on traditional software  
fuzzygroup: if not millions  
fuzzygroup: Bear in mind that an oracle license for a big website is 6 to 7 figures  
fuzzygroup: so lets say that you wanted a new data type for your site  
fuzzygroup: its cheaper to hire a consultant to tweak MySQL or Postgres than it is to buy oracle  
travisdu: ok  
fuzzygroup: (if the software otherwise meets your needs)  
travisdu: hmm.. question...  
fuzzygroup: the give back is what people have the most problem wiht generally.  
fuzzygroup: Sure  
travisdu: do the guys at Drupal eat?  
fuzzygroup: Yup.  
fuzzygroup: Most of them have day jobs or are grad students (one is writing his phd on compilers)  
fuzzygroup: A huge amount of what drives this is the "I CAN DO THIS BETTER THAN X" mantra  
fuzzygroup: over time the good projects emerge into businesses  
fuzzygroup: and the bad ones stay labors of love  
travisdu: yeah ive gotten that.  
travisdu: lol  
fuzzygroup: or if not "bad" then "small"  
travisdu: well thanks for the newbie intro to OS.  
fuzzygroup: no prb. expect to see it written up sometime  
travisdu: Its just that its hard to watch....  
fuzzygroup: what url of your should i link it to ?  
fuzzygroup: Oh it is  
fuzzygroup: it's like sausage  
fuzzygroup: you like the product  
travisdu: a product with potential....  
fuzzygroup: but you hate the process  
fuzzygroup: The way to look at it  
fuzzygroup: is that a little investment can have a big pay off  
travisdu: not have the resources of a traditional business.  
fuzzygroup: take a look at [www.kerneltrap.org](http://www.kerneltrap.org)  
fuzzygroup: that's a drupal site  
fuzzygroup: it runs on a PII 300  
fuzzygroup: and has stood up to being slashdotted i.e. featured on slashdot  
fuzzygroup: It costs Jeremy like nothing other than 1 server at an ISP  
travisdu: slashdot is a portal of some sort?  
fuzzygroup: [www.slashdot.com](http://www.slashdot.com)  
fuzzygroup: is one of the highest traffic sites on the net  
travisdu: Ahh ic  
fuzzygroup: And when a site is featured on it  
travisdu: heard the name.  
fuzzygroup: the effect is called "slashdotting"  
fuzzygroup: it generally takes the site offline  
travisdu: lol  
fuzzygroup: No seriously  
fuzzygroup: [http://radio.weblogs.com/0103807/documents/opensource\_performance.pdf](http://radio.weblogs.com/0103807/documents/opensource_performance.pdf)  
travisdu: like being on the homepage of yahoo or something.  
fuzzygroup: Yup  
fuzzygroup: That's detailed traffic metrics  
fuzzygroup: basically they saw hits go up 600%  
fuzzygroup: within an hour of being featured  
fuzzygroup: He IM'd the drupal team  
fuzzygroup: and they tuned his site for him for free in real time  
fuzzygroup: Never crashed  
fuzzygroup: never died  
fuzzygroup: Labor of love and passion isn't all bad.  
travisdu: real time....i didnt know that was possible.  
fuzzygroup: it's weird as all hell though I'll give you that  
fuzzygroup: Yup.  
fuzzygroup: Drupal has brilliant engineering underneath  
fuzzygroup: Contrast that with a microsoft product  
fuzzygroup: which would have required restarting and such  
travisdu: Yeah thats something i can "feel" just using it.  
fuzzygroup: Yup.  
fuzzygroup: So think of this in terms of your business goals  
travisdu: speaking of which will Yahoo IM ever be stable?  
fuzzygroup: lol.  
fuzzygroup: never.  
fuzzygroup: it actually can't be due to the reliance on infernal exploder technology   
travisdu: what the hell is their problem...i should have never upgraded a year ago.  
fuzzygroup: Nope.  
fuzzygroup: And, that, my friend is my whole thesis  
fuzzygroup: Bear in mind that from a perspective of engineering  
fuzzygroup: we are at a point where its time to give it up   
fuzzygroup: and admit that the classical software engineering models of proprietary development just don't work anymore  
fuzzygroup: If I had to put money on it, I'd bet that in the next 2 to 5 years you will see the entire commerical software business implode  
travisdu: No way.  
fuzzygroup: as customers say "You know this sh\* doesn't work"  
fuzzygroup: Yup.  
travisdu: to fast.  
fuzzygroup: Don't think so  
fuzzygroup: Ever read "The Tipping Point"  
travisdu: Look at medicine....  
travisdu: that model has lasted a long long time and only now is showing signs of imploding.  
fuzzygroup: Also bear in mind that the OS revolution isn't new   
travisdu: its a very slow process.  
fuzzygroup: it's \> 15 years old now.  
fuzzygroup: Yes but high tech is the fastest cycle on the planet  
travisdu: hmm....thats true.  
fuzzygroup: and people are more pissed off than ever now  
fuzzygroup: I mean I'm a serious alpha geek on all dimensions  
fuzzygroup: and even I can't make this sh\* work generally.  
travisdu: lol no?  
fuzzygroup: Right now windows restarts cost me $4,500 annually in down time on my personal desktop  
fuzzygroup: alone  
fuzzygroup: and that's conservative metrics  
travisdu: Ok but if OS is to survive then.....  
travisdu: it needs a body of people to organize its flow.  
fuzzygroup: (i did the cost factor analysis, I used to be a VP of engineering with 45 guys under me)  
fuzzygroup: Yes and No.  
fuzzygroup: Are you familiar with emergent systems and self organizing networks ?  
travisdu: yes they either dissipate or evolve to higher order.  
fuzzygroup: Yup.  
fuzzygroup: And think about Linux itself  
fuzzygroup: that's what happened to it.  
fuzzygroup: It organized itself into RedHat, Mandrake, GenToo, etc.  
travisdu: So why so few viable products so far from OS?  
travisdu: in comparison.  
fuzzygroup: Few ?  
fuzzygroup: There aren't few.   
travisdu: yes....products that have made the jump to....  
fuzzygroup: I think that most of them   
fuzzygroup: are ones that miss your personal radar.  
travisdu: why no mainstream then?  
fuzzygroup: well.  
travisdu: thats a viable arguement.  
fuzzygroup: Define Mainstream.  
fuzzygroup: If mainstream = desktop  
fuzzygroup: then yes  
travisdu: Their is a IM that is....  
travisdu: OS  
travisdu: and I dont use it.  
fuzzygroup: if Mainstream = server  
travisdu: cause its not as functional.  
fuzzygroup: You mean Jabber ?  
travisdu: correct  
travisdu: I use Trellian instead  
fuzzygroup: Which Jabber client are you running ?  
fuzzygroup: And do you use Trillian because it has interop or because of its features ?  
travisdu: hmmm....mostly interop  
fuzzygroup: (disclaimer - I hate trillian with the passion of a thousand dying suns)  
travisdu: lol why?  
fuzzygroup: Oh god. Sec for the url.  
travisdu: ok  
fuzzygroup: It sucks rocks basically
