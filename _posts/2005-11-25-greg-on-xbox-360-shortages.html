<p>Surprisingly enough, Greg Stein, showed up in my blog comments with some very cogent thoughts on the XBox 360 shortage. Greg's a serious gamer and the person who turned me onto the astounding zen experience that is Katamari (thx man I did actually buy it and we all love it). Anyway read what <a href="http://fuzzyblog.wordpress.com/2005/11/22/buying-an-xbox-360/">Greg has to say here</a>.</p>
