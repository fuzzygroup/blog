</center>

* * *

**Belmont, Massachusetts, USA / Trieste, Italy. -- June 15, 2002 --** Taking a major step forward, eVectors, Srl today announced the formation of eVectors, U.S.A., a subsidiary focused on bringing the IdeaTools content management system

&nbsp;

the enterprise class content management market, The Drupal Project today announced Drupal 4, a substantially enhanced version of the Drupal open source content management platform.&nbsp; Drupal 4 includes both significant new features as well as a dramatic architectural shift into a fully modular, easily customizable system.&nbsp; Thanks to this architecture, Drupal is now really a platform for any type of web application as users can easily extend it and modify it to better fit their needs.

#### Drupal Provides a Robust, Modular Architecture for Content Management

Since its start in December of 2000, Drupal has evolved from a simple content platform into a full fledged, modular architecture platform for web applications.&nbsp; Among the new features in Drupal 4 are:

- Blogger API support allowing Drupal to both be posted to and post with the Blogger API 
- Automatic notification to [www.weblogs.com](http://www.weblogs.com/) of changes to a user's blog 
- An integrated multi-level, multi-attribute taxonomy 
- Enhanced Change tracking 
- Significantly improved theme system 
- Next generation distributed authentication based on XML-RPC allows users to be identified with existing Drupal logins (even across sites) or Jabber or Yahoo logins 
- OPML support for generating XML based outlines via an optional module 
- Full support for XHTML 
- Content Versioning Support 
- Improved News Aggregator and enhanced RSS Support 
- A large number of additional changes -- please see the official [Change Log](http://www.drupal.org/CHANGELOG)

"With close to 100 major sites running Drupal, I anticipate our 4 release being widely adopted.&nbsp; Not only are there substantial new features but Drupal's innovative caching system has been greatly enhanced providing even better performance than ever [before](http://radio.weblogs.com/0103807/documents/opensource_performance.pdf).&nbsp; I'd like to take this opportunity to extend my thanks to the whole Drupal developer community.&nbsp; With developers from all parts of Europe and the U.S., Drupal is really an international open source project.&nbsp;" says Kjartan Mannes, one of the Team Leads for the Drupal 4 release.

#### About Drupal

Since its start in December of 2000, Drupal has grown into an industrial strength content management solution&nbsp;that can be applied to a variety of different websites including blogs, portals and more.&nbsp; Drupal is written PHP version 4 and supports a variety of back end databases including MySQL, Postgres SQL and Oracle.

More information on Drupal is available from the main Drupal developer site, [www.drupal.org](http://www.drupal.org/) and the Drupal community forum at [www.drop.org](http://www.drop.org/).&nbsp; For a complete list of features, please see the official [change log](http://www.drupal.org/CHANGELOG).

Drupal is the English pronunciation for the Dutch word '[druppel](http://www.drupal.org/)' which stands for '[drop](http://www.drop.org/)'. Drupal is a content management/discussion engine suitable to setup or build a content driven or community driven website. We aim towards easy installation, excessive configuration and fine-grained maintenance capabilities. Due to its modular design Drupal is flexible and easy to adapt or extend. Drupal is written using [PHP](http://www.php.net/). The source code is available under terms of the [GNU General Public License (GPL)](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).  
  
**Mission statement**  
  
To develop a leading edge open-source content management system that implements the latest thinking in community publishing, knowledge management, and software design. We value flexibility, simplicity, and utility in our product; teamwork, innovation, and openness in our community; and modularity, extensibility and maintainability in our code.
