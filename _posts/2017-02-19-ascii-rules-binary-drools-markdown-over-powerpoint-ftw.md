When an engineer leaves an organization there is a vital need to capture knowledge from that engineer.  In short that engineer needs to give a presentation or presentations.  And if they've been there a long time, say 7 years or so, capturing that amount of knowledge is damn near impossible.  Or so I would have thought.  Over the past 48 hours I have authored over 265 slides organized into 22 presentations outlining my knowledge on a project that I am transitioning out of.  Yeah -- the 7 years is me.  

My secret weapon for this was actually MarkDown.  Here's what I did:

* Buy a copy of [DeckSet](http://www.decksetapp.com/) or use [MARP](https://github.com/yhatt/marp)
* Write your slides in a limited subset of markdown where --- delimits a slide and ## is a slide title
* Write in your programming editor
* Present with DeskSet or MARP (MARP doesn't really have a presentation mode but it works kind of ok and is cross platform)
* Use [ScreenFlow](http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm) to record your screen
* Pray hard that you have a brilliant friend like [Nick Janetakis](https://nickjanetakis.com/) who knows how to set your audio options correctly so your voice doesn't sound horrible and then thank him profusely for listening to 4 different versions of audio until it was just right.  Or you could just buy his Docker courses(https://nickjanetakis.com/products/); I did and they are awesome.

Seriously - 265 slides in 48 hours.  There is no way I could have done that with PowerPoint.  Being able to work in my code editor and focus on pure content made all the difference.

Note: I used to build corporate enterprise knowledge management systems back in the 90s and sold them to clients like the U.S. Navy, etc.  This, with about $130 of software, was a better knowledge capture solution than what we used to ship for about $250,000 / installation.  My how the world has changed.
