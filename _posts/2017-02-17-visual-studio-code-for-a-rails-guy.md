Editors are among the stickiest of software tools for a developer.  Want to get me to change editors -- good luck!  I've been using [TextMate](https://macromates.com/) since 2006 now and only switched off the long obsolete TextMate 1 to TextMate 2 about a year ago.  Editors are just that sticky.  Here are some of the things I've tried and rejected since the point I realized that I'm stuck in legacy land:

* Sublime (didn't feel right)
* Atom (too slow)
* VIM (been there; done that; got the t-shirt; ;wore the t-shirt until it was threadbare; wrote several hundred k lines of code in it from 2002 to 2005; no thanks; only server side from now on and even then there's swearing; love it conceptually; hate to configure it)
* MacVIM (didn't feel right)

Again and again I walk away from TextMate but I keep coming back.  However, recently, [Nick](http://nickjanetakis.com/blog/) has convinced me to try Visual Studio Code and I'm **intrigued**.  As someone who literally came of computing age with Microsoft IDEs and then fled into *nix ecosystems screaming, I never expected myself to once again be in a Microsoft produced editor and I would have bet money that that editor would NOT run on Linux -- I would be wrong, 1000% wrong.  Visual Studio Code: 

* Feels Great
* Runs on Linux
* Performs Pretty Well
* Has An Enormous Plugin Library

# Installation on OSX and Linux

Start with the installation instructions [here](http://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview).  Here are the Mac and Linux downloads:

* [Mac](http://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac)
* [Linux](http://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux)

# Installation on Linux

I had some post install issues here so I'm going to cover this in a later post.

# Summary

Visual Studio Code really, really feels good.  I am still falling back to TextMate but that's mostly from convenience and muscle memory.  I think I have to keep trying Visual Studio Code.  The fact that its available on OSX and Linux is a huge, huge win in its favor.  And since my Linux box has more memory than any OSX box I own, well, perhaps the memory overhead of Electron won't matter so much.
