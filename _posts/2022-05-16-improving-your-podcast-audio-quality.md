The quality of your recorded audio for an at home podcaster is a black art.  Audio is a fundamentally analog process and Once upon a time, in the antediluvian ages of podcasting (2005 / 2006), I was a podcaster.  And then, a decade later, my friend Nick Janetakis, a producer of online courses also taught me a bunch of things about audio quality.  

Here's one thing to know:

> You will tell yourself that you can clean up the audio later.  This will **ALMOST NEVER** happen.  Getting the audio right at record time is key.

Here are some tips:

1. **A good mic**.  I use A Yeti Blue USB for about $149 and that's more than good enough.
2. **A pop filter**.  This is a cheap ($10) foam filter that goes in front of your mic and reduces mouth / breath noise.
3. **Put a towel under your laptop**.  Laptops have fans and fans are mechanical and vibrate.  Also your movement on the keys / mouse will make noise.  A towel under the laptop acts as a shock absorber for movement / vibration.
4. **Put your phone into do not disturb mode**.  If you are an iPhone user then set it to Do Not Disturb.  If you have overrides on this for say calls / texts from family then create a Really Do Not Disturb (or call it Podcasting) setting and do not have overrides.
5. **Turn off all your phone alarms**.  Make sure they are off.
6. **Leave your phone in the other room**.  This is the easiest one.
7. **Get rid of your chair with casters / the ability to lean back**.  Chairs move.  A mic will pick this up.
8. **Experiment with different USB ports for your mic**.  Different ports may have different isolation levels from the underlying circuitry of the machine.  You may have less electrical hum / cross talk when you plug it on the right (or the left).
9. **Log out of all Instant Messaging tools on your laptop**.  Again you want to suppress notification noises.
10.  **Don't record in a room with hardwood floors**.  Audio reverberates far more than you would think.
11. **Record in the clothes / coat closet**.  A closet with clothes in it is actually a very silent area and the clothes eliminate audio bouncing back on you from the walls / ceiling / floor.
