So the other day we had the gitlab disaster.  As my friend Nick described it to me via chat: 

> did you hear about gitlab?

> an ops guy did rm -rf on a production db with 300GB of data by accident, and they lost 295GB of data -- luckily it was only on a backup, but they are expecting 6h of data loss for production data [Nick](http://nickjanetakis.com)

Or as Robin might say in a grim and gritty version: **Holy F'ing Hell Batman!**  

Apparently they were using short names like db1.foo.com and db2.foo.com.  Nick's comment on Hacker News was to the effect of their [naming structure was wrong](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13539876) and that a name like dbproduction might have saved the day.  

Perhaps but I've seen a lot of this kind of stuff over the years.  Happily I've only ever had one such incident - I actually dropped a table once during a group pairing session with [Dv](http://dasari.com) and [Jared](http://www.alloycode.com/) due to getting confused between production and development.

The thing that I've wanted most of all to address this is **color**.  If you look at the structure of the brain we have an inordinate amount of our cortex devoted to visual processing -- why not approach that to preventing stupid terminal mistakes?  What I've wanted for years upon years is really simple - I want my terminal window to change color when I log into a remote server.  If its a staging server or a back up server give me a light gray background.  If its a production web or api server then give me a green background and if its a production database server then give me a BRIGHT RED BACKGROUND.

The iTerm2 badging feature can do a bit of this but its not in your face enough to really protect you.  I suspect that with sufficient console trickery this is possible but neither I or Dv ever managed to accomplish it.  Personally I think its important enough that I'd name it the GitLab feature and built it into iTerm but that's not my core skill set.  Still I'm putting it out there.  Thoughts?
