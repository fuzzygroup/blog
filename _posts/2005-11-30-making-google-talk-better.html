<p>Hm... I'm a self admitted IM freak. I use IM religiously and devoutly, normally logging 12+ hours daily on IM. So I tried the new Gtalk client recently and it had some problems that affect me, being an IM freak, that I'd love to see addressed. I doubt they will be since I'm utterly not the target demographic (non advanced end user) but giving them some ideas is my daily positive karma contribution:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standard Windows Interface</strong>. I'm not sure what is it about writing an IM client which makes you want to change the core OS interface but Gtalk, like Trillian, does this. Example -- why isn't there a maximize button? See my previous <a href="http://72.14.203.104/search?q=cache:eESAFLgCRI0J:www.fuzzygroup.com/writing/marketing101_case_study_trillian.htm+trillian+fuzzygroup&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a">Trillian essay</a> about this.  Trillian is a brilliant product but I don't want to learn how to use a very different set of GUI primitives.</li>
<li><strong>Logging</strong>. Yes Virginia I know that IM logs are loved by some and hated by others but, if you need them, not having them is killer. I just had one of the best IM sessions in a long time over Gtalk and at the end of it I needed to capture the urls, thoughts, etc and I knew that if I closed the window w/o saving it to a file I was hosed. Files are so 1980s anyway. Particularly when you need to copy the text, launch notepad, save it and so on. Which brings us to ...</li>
<li><strong>Redefine Logging</strong>. IM logs are very, very useful but rarely implemented in a useful fashion. Logs w/o search are like peanut butter w/o chocolate -- they go great together! There's an interesting IM product on the Mac, Chatalog, I think the name is which forwards your chats to your .mac email account. Why not a default folder named "IM Conversations" with sub folders for "Bob", "Bill", etc and each im convo saved there. IM and email are really two halves of the same whole -- online interaction either synchronous or asynchronous.</li>
<li><strong>Tabs</strong>. Conversations need to live in tabs. Tabs need to be available vertically or horizontally. Vertically gives a lot more concurrent convos which is key.</li>
<li><strong>Windows are Cognitive Burdens</strong>. I've never understood the separation between buddy list and conversation windows once im clients have a tabbed interface. Having more windows to manage is a distinct cognitive burden. I know it doesn't seem like much but it is. That is, after all, why you see even Microsoft lessening the reliance on MDI.  Why isnt the address book just a tree control in a split pane ?</li>
<li><strong>Pictures in the Address Book</strong>.  I don't know about you, but for at least certain people, I'd far rather have a picture of them than their name.  I'd much rather send my wife an IM by clicking on her pretty face than "waytoolongrandomimhandle".</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Identity</strong>.  Like a lot of IM junkies I have *ahem* multiple accounts.  There's fuzzygroup my erstwhile personal IM handle.  And then there's feedster2003 for handling Feedster support and then there's *censored* which I use solely for when I need someone to be able to contact me and I need to focus and can't stay online in a general context.  And there's more.  For me IM accounts are a bit like bunnies; they keep popping up.  Now this is an edge case that's far over the line but I suspect most people who do even a little bit of serious IM at least make the work versus home distinction -- or they would if the client supported it.  I personally live and die by <a href="http://gaim.sf.net/">Gaim</a> because of three things:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>logging</li>
<li>tabs</li>
<li>multiple identity</li>
</ul>
<div align="left">Anyway that's my .02.  Overall I really do like Gtalk and while it isn't right for me at present, its actually pretty damn awesome.  Thanks Google!</div>
