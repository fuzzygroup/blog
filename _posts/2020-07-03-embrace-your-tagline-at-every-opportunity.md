I have been, since my very first foray into startups, a huge advocate of the **tag line**.  A tag line is that one to 10 word phrase that encapsulates exactly what you are building.  I talk about this in my document on [Opportunity Profiles](https://fuzzyblog.io/blog/startup/2020/01/04/startup-coach-01-the-opportunity-profile.html) where I identify it as one of the first things you write down when planning a new venture.

This morning, as I engaged in my "just out of bed, the brain is fresh, work on something new and interesting" moment of my day, I found a new way to embrace the tag line.  Yesterday was I brainstormed on something and what felt like a new perfect tag line was uttered.  So I did two things today:

1.  I put that tag line and the other candidates into code.  This means that not only are the written down but they are under version control so I can get back to them as needed.  You never know how a project morphs and changes as it weaves its way towards the market and being able to get back to a tag line, I've found, is vital.
2. I added it to the project's user interface as part of its footer.  This means that every time that I look at what I'm building, I will see it and, hopefully, be inspired by it.  

Here's an example of #2 (this is just the footer not the project itself).

The tag line is the text on the left in bold.  And if you find that tag line intriguing then:

* That's great; it means it might be right; validation on these things is key and should be sought as early as possible
* You know where to find me if you want to ask about it (contact info is on the bottom of every page; look down)
