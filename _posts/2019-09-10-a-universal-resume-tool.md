Ah insomnia.  I clearly should not be out on the Internet late at night -- I should be sleeping but the result is a swath of Internet goodness that I've found and am now writing about.  This find is "Universal Resume" which is an NPM project to produce a good looking resume website for yourself.  [Here's an example](https://universal-resume.netlify.com/).

Here are the links:

* [Example](https://universal-resume.netlify.com/) -- see what a resume looks like.
* [The Code](https://github.com/WebPraktikos/universal-resume) -- try it for yourself
* [See what others think](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20923823) -- the Hacker News discussion

While I'm not an NPM guy (or a JavaScript guy at all), I will admit that this looks better than my [outdated online resume](https://fuzzyblog.io/blog/resume.html).

Hm... Perhaps I should talk to this person about incorporating this into Job Hound as a resume hosting feature ...
