<p>Its been a while since I took a look at Pito Salas' <a href="http://www.blogbridge.com/">BlogBridge</a> news aggregator and, I have to say, its just plain beautiful.  Wonderfully designed, easy to setup, cross platform and just plain nice.  There's lots more good stuff inside but since I'm dashing for a plane, this is all I had time to post.  Thanks Pito.  Great stuff.</p>
