I don't generally do the retrospective (save in an agile context) -- I prefer to look forward.  And, yes, I'll admit that given some of the crap in my personal life these days, there's a reason for that.  Now, that said, I've been thinking back over my 2019 year and I wanted to comment on my single best development decision of 2019:

> Buying [Jumpstart Pro](https://jumpstartrails.com/) was my single best development decision in all of 2019.

Like a lot of developers out there, I'm a back end guy.  Yes I can do front end stuff but it tends towards a local maxima that might best be defined as **ugly** or even, perhaps, **fugly**.  And, now, I can happily say *never again*.

Jumpstart Pro is an application template for your next Rails app that gives you:

* A prebuilt starting point
* where the things that you are going to do anyway are already done
* like devise
* like a CSS grid (Tailwind) 
* like transactional email
* like html templates that look good
* like a scaffolding generator that is all setup including tests
* like ...

I bought Jumpstart Pro back in August when I had a side project that I was already pretty deep into and since Jumpstart Pro is best for *new* projects, well, I put it aside -- and that was **stupid** of me.  I should have trusted that [Chris Oliver](https://www.gorails.com/), the author of Jumpstart, made Jumpstart awesome -- because he did.  When I finally realized how good Jumpstart was, well, I started a different side project because I wanted to experience Rails from his perspective.  And now that I'm about to ship this new side project, the only thing I have to say is **absolutely worth it**.  

Best damn development decision I made in 2019.  Recommended.
