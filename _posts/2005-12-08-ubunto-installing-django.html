<p>So I've decided to go with Django as my 1st python web framework.  The <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/download/">documentation</a> is basically spot on but I hit a typically bizarre setup error about not being able to find make files under the python directory so I loaded up Synaptic Package manager and selected Autoconf and then did a search for python and basically selected close to everything and clicked update and it just plain worked.  Outstanding!</p>
