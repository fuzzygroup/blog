I had an age old discussion via IM last night with my buddy Ray (the satellite guy).&nbsp; He's now working onsite for a company ([www.digitalglobe.com](http://www.digitalglobe.com/)) and, worse, working far from home.&nbsp; He needs a remote machine for personal use (he has computers at the&nbsp;office, company provided) and is in the "Do I Desktop&nbsp;It or Laptop It ?" quandry.&nbsp; Boy.... Nothing really changes, does it?&nbsp; I've been in this one so many&nbsp;times it's not funny.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tend to almost always go for the laptop but not at all for the reason that you think.&nbsp; Here's the quick and dirty pros and cons:

Just a general comment -- even though we all want to pretend that we really need that sexy new P4, we don't.&nbsp; We honestly don't.&nbsp; Machines are so fast these days that unless you need to do video editing, almost anything sold within 2 years is fine.&nbsp; I know that Microsoft and Intel hate this with a flaming passion.&nbsp; So what?&nbsp; It doesn't make it any less true.&nbsp; Even servers don't have to be all that fast.&nbsp; Here's a [PII 300 server](http://radio.weblogs.com/0103807/documents/opensource_performance.pdf) that withstood being slashdotted.&nbsp; PII 300...

Now, with all the disadvantages of laptops, why do I choose laptops time and again?&nbsp; Simple.&nbsp; Offsite Backup.&nbsp; Huh?&nbsp; What? The way I look at it, I'm going to always have some type of desktop.&nbsp; They're so cheap now a days that you just can't NOT buy one.&nbsp; And, even the dirt cheap ones are good, I ran for \> 3 years a celeron that cost me only $299 (yes, an e-Machines) and while I wouldn't use it for kernel rebuilds, even with 192K of RAM, it is pretty much fine (I'm still using it now on and off).&nbsp;

The real benefit of a laptop, from my perspective, is that if I have a laptop and I'm willing to carry it regularly, it pretty much gives me **offsite backup** -- if I mirror my important data onto it.&nbsp; I've been doing this since about 1990 and it's always worked really well for me.&nbsp; Recommended.

If you want to do an even better job of this then here's what I also do:

- Get a small, light laptop.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; You're more likely to carry it.&nbsp; Ever since I moved to Thinkpads, I tend to carry it about 20% more of the time. 
- Get one with a removable hard drive.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; That's even smaller!&nbsp; And, if you are traveling for business, you can drop it in your bag, in a static proof container, and leave the laptop at the hotel.&nbsp; (Looking for a great place to hide a laptop in a hotel room ? email me -- I don't want it on a web page).

And, finally, if you want to get a laptop cheap then I recommend:

- Dell Clearance (don't ask for the url, the last time I found it, it took 20 minutes of poking around for it) 
- [PC Connection Close Out](http://www.pcconnection.com/scripts/searchresults.asp?SR=1&ER=10&TR=0&ST=CS&PP=0&sortval=Price&plattype=A&MktGroupID=177&Find+Products.x=33&Find+Products.y=7) (and even their refurbished ones are damn good and have warranty) 
- [www.half.com](http://www.half.com) (never used but hear good things) 
- [www.ebay.com](http://www.ebay.com) (usual caveats) 
- [http://www.clearanceclub.com/](http://www.clearanceclub.com/) (no idea but someone just recommended it to me, sorry I forget who) 
- [http://www.dovebid.com/default.asp](http://www.dovebid.com/default.asp)&nbsp;(sometimes but not always)

My general recommendation, hands down, PC Connection Clearance.&nbsp; [General](http://www.pcconnection.com/scripts/clearance.asp) & [Laptops](http://www.pcconnection.com/scripts/searchresults.asp?SR=1&ER=10&TR=0&ST=CS&PP=0&sortval=Price&plattype=A&MktGroupID=177&Find+Products.x=33&Find+Products.y=7).&nbsp; Despite their recent "I wanna be a spammer" madness, this is a great company with great service.&nbsp; Examples of prices:

- [<font face="Arial" size="2">Recon. iBook G3 500/128/15/24X/56K/NIC/12.1"TFT</font>](http://www.pcconnection.com/scripts/productdetail.asp?product_id=284950)<font size="2"> -</font> $1049 (no idea if that's good, not up on Mac hardware.&nbsp; See [www.smalldog.com](http://www.smalldog.com) for Mac stuff too, thanks [Russ](http://lipton.blogs.at/)) 
- [<font face="Arial" size="2">Evo N115 AMD Athlon 1.2GHz/128/20/DVD/56K/NIC/14.1"/XPP</font>](http://www.pcconnection.com/scripts/productdetail.asp?product_id=283281)&nbsp;- $1339  

**NOTE:** These prices aren't as cheap as I've seen in the past.&nbsp; The close out stuff always ebbs and flows, so watch it regularly.

One last, last thing?&nbsp; Get the extended warranty if available.&nbsp; Laptops break all the time.&nbsp; All the time.
