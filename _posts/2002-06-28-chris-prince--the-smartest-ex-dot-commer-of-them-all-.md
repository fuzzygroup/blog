<font size="+1"><b>Chris Prince: The Smartest ex-Dot Commer of them All ?</b></font>

NOTE: This turned out to be way longer than I expected it to be since I had to set up the context, explain the players and such.&nbsp; I think you'll find it very, very&nbsp;amusing.

You know how there are people in your life that you just lose touch with and then when you do meet up with them again, you're just plain surprised?&nbsp; I ran into this with my buddy Chris Prince recently and I have to think that he's, well, the **Smartest ex-Dot Commer of them all**.&nbsp; Here's what happened...

Once upon a time, in an era of huge corporate dysfunction and silly ass expectations of instant millions, in a moment of insanity, I joined a dot com and became a&nbsp;whore for money -- NOT ever a good choice.&nbsp; And, while it was one of the worst experiences of my professional life, I met lots of good people (not the management team, not at all, repeat not at all, the people who did the work).&nbsp; People like my partner [Gretchen](http://www.fuzzygroup.com/about/), my friend Derrick (hardest working man I know), [Craig](http://www.webskylines.com/) the designer and Chris Prince.&nbsp; Here's the deal with Chris Prince.

At Mascot I came in as "Senior Director of Product Marketing" and a member of the Executive Team.&nbsp; When it became apparent that the current person in charge of Engineering wasn't scaling to the task (and it was a big damn task), I was asked to take over.&nbsp; After giving it clearly too little thought, I agreed, renegotiated a generous compensation package and attacked the problem with my normal excessive degree of energy.&nbsp;

In any development team there are always a few key members and one of the most important is the Lead Engineer, the one guy who knows almost everything.&nbsp; And, just as a good lead engineer can make a project, a bad lead engineer can kill a project.&nbsp; Chris was my Lead Engineer.&nbsp; And he was awesome.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've had lots of lead engineers over the years and he was in the top 10 for sure.&nbsp; Like all the good lead engineers I've ever had, Chris didn't have a fancy pedigree.&nbsp; He went to Suny, did a stint in the Navy
