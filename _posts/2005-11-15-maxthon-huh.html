<p>Dear <a href="http://chris.pirillo.com/">Chris</a>,   </p>
<p>I just decided to follow your advice and install <a href="http://www.maxthon.com/">Maxthon</a>.  And, while I applaud you for your enthusiasm for this product, after about 5 minutes of trying it, all I have to say is this:   </p>
<p align="center">Huh???</p>
<p>  I'm really, really glad that Maxthon works for you but it just doesn't work at all for me.  Here's why:
<ol>
<li><strong>CTRL+T.</strong>  No support for CTRL+T to create a new tab.  Given that I'm hugely used to FireFox, when I tried Maxathon and found that CTRL+T did not create a new tab, I was just spooked from the beginning.  Yes I know that Maxthon predates Firefox but I'm kind of surprised that since it knows I had Firefox and offered to import my thousands of bookmarks that it didn't automatically set CTRL+T for me.  (Ok this is a stretch but when you're an alternative product struggling for market share wouldn't this be a great approach?)</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Feed Support.</strong>  I know that I've seen you rave about its RSS support but when I went to <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/">Jeremy's blog</a> and clicked on one of his <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/linkblog/index.xml">RSS icons</a>, I get <a href="http://feedster.net/i/maxathonfeed.jpg">this</a>.  I'm sorry but having a feed displayed when you click on an RSS icon isn't a good user experience.  Shouldn't Maxathon have recognized the feed and displayed it in its aggie ?
</li>
<li><strong>Refresh Button.</strong>  I was testing some new Feedster Ajax features in Maxathon to see if they were compatible with IE's XML model so I needed to regularly refresh the page.  Where's the Refresh icon or button?  Here's what Maxathon looks like on <a href="http://feedster.net/i/maxathonrefresh.jpg">my System</a>.
</li>
<li><strong>OPML Support.</strong>  I couldn't find it.  Is it here? </li>
</ol>
<p> Any thoughts?  I do trust your opinion on stuff so I'm curious.  It might be just that I'm so used to FireFox / Mozilla that I'm just not able to properly grok the Zen of Maxathon.  So did I miss something when you raved about Maxathon ?   Thanks man.  Hope all is well with you and <a href="http://ponzarelli.com/">Ponzi</a>. </p>
