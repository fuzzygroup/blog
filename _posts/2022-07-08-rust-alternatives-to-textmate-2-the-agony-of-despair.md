**Note**: This has now appeared on Hacker News -- thank you for the upvotes; I'm very flattered.  I got some good information on Lapce from - maybe - the author and I've updated that.

The older I get and remain an *active* software engineer, the less accepting I am of **poor software quality**.  I think all of us gray beards know that software crashes, generally, are a choice of the developer in terms of his:

* technology platform -- some technologies are inherently riskier than others i.e. "Friends don't let friends use C++"  or "Practice safe computing my son"
* development practices -- things like test driven development and pair programming (stop arguing on pair programming; we can debate this later; I'll wager I've spent more time actively pairing than you) that demonstrably improve code quality
* engineering philosophy -- Erlang is a fabulous demonstration that by embracing failure you can make more reliable software

But when you fail to address any of the above, you end up with today's software quality crisis -- crashes, bloat and more.  And, honestly, I'm tired of it.

This morning, at about 6:53 am, my beloved TextMate 2, an editor that less than 2 hours ago, I had typed into a Discourse thread "You can pry out of my cold dead hands", went insane once again.  TextMate 2 has a lockup context where it won't crash but it will just sit there and refuse to respond to keystrokes.  Then you have to force quit it and depending on the severity of its insanity will recover its context on restart or not.  This is why I write down things like this:

* [Fixing TextMate 2 When It Goes Insane](https://fuzzyblog.io/blog/textmate/2020/01/15/fixing-textmate-2-when-it-goes-insane.html)
* [Forensic Computing 1 - Finding TextMate Untitled Documents](https://fuzzyblog.io/blog/text/2017/10/08/forensic-computing-1-finding-textmate-untitled-documents.html)
* [Adding AutoSave on Focus Lost to TextMate 2](Adding AutoSave on Focus Lost to TextMate 2)

> Sidebar: When TextMate had to be Force Quit, it was using 1.76 gigs of RAM.  Now, despite doing nothing but opening this one document (and all my history it recovered), it is now using 2.93 gigs of RAM.  This document is only 562 words.  Somehow, maybe it is just me, that doesn't explain the additional 1.18 gigs of RAM used for just 562 words.  I am on a computer with 64 gigs of RAM and 1/20th of that is my FSCKING TEXT EDITOR!!!

Every time you have a crash in something as fundamental as an editor for a software developer, it is an excuse for someone to lose focus, stop, take a break, etc.  Me?  I went to the grocery story -- at a point when I had been closing in on making a release of an open source package I've been promising myself to finish for **6 years**.  I still haven't gotten back to that Zen point of coding I had been at even though hours have passed.  I am instead still fuming and looking for a different editor and writing this rant.  And that's why I hate crashes.  

**Note**: I have now been writing about this since 2003 when I first (roughly) calculated the impact of Windows stability on the economy in terms of reboot resulting time away from work.

It has been said that insanity is doing the same thing repeatedly and expecting different results.  And, yes, I've been expecting classically written software to simply get better over time.  This clearly isn't going to happen so it is time to look for alternatives.

## About Rust

Rust is a relatively new programming language with a focus on speed, correctness and memory safety.  Rust essentially makes the crazy gyrations that are so common -- and inherently wrong -- in C derived languages so hard that you simply don't make them.  And this:

1. Makes Rust hard to learn.
2. Self selects the programmers willing to learn rust down to an elite handful.
3. Results in higher quality software.

I don't think I'm incorrect in saying that when a piece of software written in Rust exists, it is going to be higher quality than something written in C / Swift / C++ / Java.  And, because of that, I have started using more software written in Rust whenever possible.  I recently switched my terminal from iTerm 2 to [Warp.dev](https://www.warp.dev/) because of this.

## What Do I Need in an Editor

I'm a hard core rubyist with a focus on Rails.  Yes I do other languages but the Ruby stuff is not going to change.  Here's what I need in an editor:

1. Graphical; Sorry I do like the WIMP interface; I did my half million lines of code in VIM and I love Bram Moolenar but no; just no
2. Basic conformation to platform conventions
3. Able to be invoked easily from the command line and open a directory of files with a tree view on the left
4. Able to be used for documents (markdown / ascii) as well as code
5. Syntax highlighting
6. Keystroke macro recording
7. Autosave on focus lost
8. Extensibility if at all possible; TextMate succeeded in large part because there are bundles for everything 
9. A window menu that lists all windows
10. Configurable keystrokes
11. Fuzzy Finder for quick navigation to files
12. Cross file search
13. Features need to be discoverable
14. Fast
15. Side by Side display.  TextMate doesn't have this but I noticed it in Lapce and added it to the list because it was that damn impressive.
16. Has to be low enough overhead that I can create a new doc, not bother to save it, drop some text bits into it and get back to it when I please; in essence I'm treating editor windows / buffers at virtual scraps of paper.  Periodically I will recurse through them and deal with but it may not be for weeks. And don't tell me that's my problem -- right now I have 50 windows open.  Each with maybe a few K of text.  On a 64 gig machine.

And I don't have to have everything but that's the core nexus of what I use daily.

## Let's Look at Some Options

And now for the feature level comparison.  I tried to write this as a traditional table comparing all features but the blithering ball of suck that is Jekyll and table layout left me in a rage.  So there are 15 tables each of which focus on one element of the editors.  The benefit to the multiple table approach is the selective winnowing down of options.

**NOTE**: If you want a good looking, well formatted version of this then please follow this link over to the gist version of this section.

### What's Being Actively Worked On

This looks at the editors by commit count and it pretty clearly shows you what is actively under development.  With this analysis, we can reduce 8 editors down to 4.

| Editor      | Commit Count |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [amp](https://github.com/jmacdonald/amp)      | 1,170 |
| [glyph](https://github.com/zackradisic/glyph)      | 50| 
| [helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix) | 3,028 | 
| [hired](https://github.com/sidju/hired)| 78 | 
| [kibi](https://github.com/ilai-deutel/kibi) | 179 | 
| [lapce](https://github.com/lapce/lapce) | 1,669 |  
| [pepper](https://github.com/vamolessa/pepper) | 3,133 | 
| [Zed](https://zed.dev/)| ??? | 
| [zee](https://github.com/zee-editor/zee) | 137 | 

### Editing Style - Vim or Emacs

I know this isn't listed above but it is one of the great Litmus tests for editors.

| Editor      | Open |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [amp](https://github.com/jmacdonald/amp)      | Emacs |
| [helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix) | VI | 
| [lapce](https://github.com/lapce/lapce) | Graphical; modal mode for VI fans in settings(1) |  
| [zee](https://github.com/zee-editor/zee) | Emacs  | 

Normally I'd toss out anything Emacs style right from the jump but it is already a small pool.

### Graphical vs Character Mode

| Editor      | Graphical |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [amp](https://github.com/jmacdonald/amp)      | N |
| [helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix) | N | 
| [lapce](https://github.com/lapce/lapce) | Y |  
| [pepper](https://github.com/vamolessa/pepper) | N | 
| [zee](https://github.com/zee-editor/zee) | N | 

Note 1: I left Zee in here because of its 100 fps claim.  Performance really matters; they get props for realizing that.

Note 2: With exactly 1 graphical editor, I have to relax this criteria (perhaps).

### Basic Conformation to Platform Conventions

Computing platforms have a style and conforming to that style / conventions matters.

| Editor      | Graphical |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [amp](https://github.com/jmacdonald/amp)      | N |
| [helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix) | N | 
| [lapce](https://github.com/lapce/lapce) | N - Only a single menu; File picker responds to ~ but doesn't allow pasting in a path |  
| [pepper](https://github.com/vamolessa/pepper) | N | 
| [zee](https://github.com/zee-editor/zee) | N | 

Note: Given that nothing conforms to platform conventions, either I give up and go home or plow on and accept change.

Lapce gets huge props for integrating a Terminal into its environment giving a very integrated feeling.

### Invoke from Command Line and Open Directory

| Editor      | Open |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [amp](https://github.com/jmacdonald/amp)      | N |
| [helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix) | YES - Beautifully implemented; Kudos | 
| [lapce](https://github.com/lapce/lapce) | There is a basic CLI interface in HEAD not yet released so its coming!(1) |  
| [pepper](https://github.com/vamolessa/pepper) | ? | 
| [zee](https://github.com/zee-editor/zee) | ? |

### Useful for Documents

| Editor      | Open |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [amp](https://github.com/jmacdonald/amp)      | ? |
| [helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix) | ? | 
| [lapce](https://github.com/lapce/lapce) | N - Seems to be a single editor window only |  
| [pepper](https://github.com/vamolessa/pepper) | ? | 
| [zee](https://github.com/zee-editor/zee) | ? | 

### Syntax Highlighting for Ruby

| Editor      | Open |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [amp](https://github.com/jmacdonald/amp)      | Y |
| [helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix) |  N | 
| [lapce](https://github.com/lapce/lapce) | Y |  
| [pepper](https://github.com/vamolessa/pepper) | N  | 
| [zee](https://github.com/zee-editor/zee) |  | 

I was really quite sorry to see Pepper drop out here.  I was even more annoyed to see that Helix has support for syntax highlighting in Elvish but not for ruby:

And, yes, Ruby is in the damn list but opening a .rb file doesn't highlight squat.  And this must be a design decision because opening a .py file didn't work either.  Still it is 2022 -- expecting highlighting to work automatically -- in a programming editor isn't a big conceptual leap for me.  Even so the handling of opening a directory nicely has me keeping Helix in the comparison list.

This doesn't seem to be in any editor.  

**IMPORTANT**: However not only is Auto Save lacking but Lapce allows you to quit without prompting for save.  I only just discovered that or I'd have cut it from the options right here.  That's not just user hostile but basic hating on the user (imho).

### Extensibility

Yes I need to do more research here.  I freely admit that I punted on this one as I've spent far more time on this than I wanted.

### Window Menu that Lists All Windows

| [lapce](https://github.com/lapce/lapce) | N - Lapce skips this by only having 1 menu! |  
| [pepper](https://github.com/vamolessa/pepper) | N | 
| [zee](https://github.com/zee-editor/zee) | N | 

The reason for specifically listing this feature is that I'm also running Warp.dev as a terminal manager and it is written in Rust and the bizarre feature omission is a Window menu that lists all the windows.

As with extensibility, I punted on this one.

I'm pretty sure this is in at least Helix and Pepper but I didn't specifically use it.

I'm unsure of this feature because, honestly, I couldn't really find info on it.

### Discoverable Features

| [pepper](https://github.com/vamolessa/pepper) |  N| 
| [zee](https://github.com/zee-editor/zee) |  N| 

None of these editors are particularly discoverable.  The lack of overt user interfaces means they get out of the way but that has a cost of making features unknown unless you really dig in -- and you aren't likely to dig in when you can't tell if it has the features you need.

With none of the editors supporting save on loss of focus, I wouldn't come close to thinking I could use them in this way.   Auto Save, in 2022, should be a default (imho).  To paraphrase the great Ted Nelson who said something like "Real people trust the car to shift itself", I would argue "Real people trust the editor to automatically save".

### LSP Support

Some reached out to me on Twitter and confirmed that Lapce does have LSP integration -- "although we don't have much LSP plugins yet, only Rust/Go/Clangd".  That's awesome and I'll be sure to experiment with it.

Digging through Helix docs brought up the issue of LSP (language server protocol) support and the hx --health command.  Here is how it looks on my machine:

    ❯ hx --health
    Config file: default
    Language file: default
    Log file: /Users/sjohnson/.cache/helix/helix.log
    Runtime directory: /Users/sjohnson/.cargo/bin/runtime

And yes I did do a:

    brew install solargraph

and then a:

    cp /Users/sjohnson/helix/languages.toml ~/.config/helix/languages.toml

as per [this](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/340).  And then a 

    gem install --user-install solargraph

(which fails since I'm an RVM user) so then a:

    gem install solargraph

I was still left without syntax highlighting or code completion for Ruby.  Alas.

Actually I just figured it out.  Solargraph is an executable gem and when you run it like this:

    solargraph stdio

It runs as a LSP server which then Helix can use for autocomplete.  It still doesn't color code the syntax but the autocomplete options were slick as all get out.  Absolute Kudos here.

## Helix Weirdness

I tried to brew install helix as per the instructions.  This led to my needing to re-install XCode which still isn't done.  I got past it with a pure Rust install and then using Cargo.  

## Conclusion

I really, really, really wanted to make the shift away from TextMate 2 into something written in Rust.  I suspect I'll experiment with Lapce since it supports a mouse.  I'm deeply sorry that Helix didn't work out.  I could, maybe, make the transition to character mode editing if highlighting worked (and I'm sure with the right sorcery it would; I'm just too old to mess about any more).

Overall it is very early in the Rust editor space and what I use is frightfully mature -- crappy quality but damn mature.  I hope that in another year or so, I'll have better options.

## Notes: 

* Kibi is notable for being a clone of [Kilo](https://github.com/antirez/kilo) by [AntiRez](https://github.com/antirez); Kilo is one of the great current illustrative lessons in software engineering
* Zed is conceptual afaict - exists only on a web page; sounds great but absolutely NOT filling
* Zee explicitly doesn't load the [Ruby TreeSitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-ruby) grammar; for Ghu's sake Zee, Why?  It isn't like you have an anti-package philosophy like Pepper
* Zee is absolutely impressive.  Just watching the crates it uses as it compiles is like a laundry list of editor related goodness (yes I'm an editor wonk)
