<font size="+1"><b>Business 101: Working From Home -- Keeping It Under Control</b></font>

My last day of "full time" work was something like September 19, 2000. That's when I lost my temper, left my dot com and re-entered the land of "Work at Home" people.&nbsp; As you can tell from the quantity of output I produce here and other places, I'm probably the last person you'd think would be writing about keeping their work life under control.&nbsp; Arguably my work life is not under control -- it fills my very being.&nbsp; True.&nbsp; But you should bear in mind that just because someone doesn't do something, that doesn't mean they don't know how to do it -- but, perhaps, they choose not to.&nbsp; That's my situation.&nbsp; I know how to work from home and maintain a balance between work and home.&nbsp; I'm choosing not to, for now, at least that's what I tell myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway ...&nbsp;

<font size="4"><strong>12 Tips for Working from Home But Keeping it Under Control</strong></font>

1. **Dress For Success**.&nbsp;I know, I know.&nbsp; If you work from home, you can work in your pajamas.&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; But you'd be surprised at how good just putting on a clean, pressed shirt makes you feel.&nbsp; Even if you are wearing cut off jeans.&nbsp; It still feels good.&nbsp; Bear in mind that this builds a psychological demarcation between "work" and "home" -- even though they are one and the same for you.&nbsp; (And, yes, I am wearing a pressed shirt right now.&nbsp; I usually look at least ok when I work from home although the current heat wave often pushes me towards less and less clothing; quasi naked coder comes to mind...).  
  
2. **A Regular Schedule**.&nbsp; Even though you can work any hours you want, this often isn't good.&nbsp;&nbsp;People do need to be able to reach you and a regular schedule makes that easier and also lets you know that it's ok to be not working (a common anxiety for people that work from home).&nbsp; Here's an example.&nbsp; Let's say you generally rise by 8, can be at the computer by 8:30 and really, really like the TV show "Trading Spaces" on at 4 pm EST.&nbsp; Guess what!&nbsp; That's your schedule -- 8:30 to 4pm.&nbsp;   
  
3. **Take a Real Lunch Break**.&nbsp; Even if it's only 20 minutes, take a real lunch break.&nbsp; That means GET AWAY FROM THE PC!!!&nbsp; Sit at a table, read a paper, etc.&nbsp; It's very, very refreshing.  
  
4. **Avoid Email During Off Hours**.&nbsp; Yup.&nbsp; That's right.&nbsp; Avoid the demon email.&nbsp; Things generally don't need to be responded to 24/7.  
  
5. **Avoid IM During Off Hours**. Yup.&nbsp; That's right.&nbsp; Avoid the devil that is IM.&nbsp; If you are going to be offline for a while and you feel that people might need you then change your IM status indicator to something custom like "Not Available.&nbsp; If you need me, please call; You know the #".&nbsp; If it's a real emergency people will get in touch with you by voice.  
  
6. **Keep the PC in a Separate Room**.&nbsp; You do not want to do what I do which is keeping your entire computer setup in your living room (Yes Virginia, it is tasteful; it's not a typical bachelor setup).&nbsp; If you can always see it then you're always tempted to do work.&nbsp; If you don't have a separate room then cover it up if possible.&nbsp; Stick it in a corner that you don't regularly use.&nbsp;   
  
7. **Keep the Room Closed**.&nbsp; And, even if you have it in another room, SHUT THE DOOR!!!&nbsp; Seriously, keeping it out of sight is a big home / work separator if you can do it.  
  
8. **Make a List of Daily Goals**.&nbsp; One of the best things you can do is make a list of daily goals and then follow through on them.&nbsp; And bear in mind that there's a big difference between "Tasks" and "Goals".&nbsp; We all make lists of tasks (well lots of us do).&nbsp; But then our task lists&nbsp;get just plain too long.&nbsp; A set of daily goals is just that -- the things that really need to get done that day and that day only.&nbsp; (And, yes, I'm implementing this as a [FuzzyOffice](http://www.fuzzygroup.net/products/fuzzyoffice/) feature since it's a huge, huge, huge help).  
  
9. **Then Go "Home" When You're Done**.&nbsp; If you're done early with your daily goals then bear in mind that it's ok to "leave" early also.&nbsp; Think about it -- that's what you would do in a real company.&nbsp; Why should you treat yourself all that differently just because you work at home.  
  
10. **Make Exceptions Wisely**.&nbsp; Sure if you have a big deadline, you're going to alter this and go all out to get it done.&nbsp; If that's the case then I strongly recommend that you advance to #12.&nbsp; That's what you'd do if you weren't working from home.  
  
11. **Take a Day Off from Time to Time**.&nbsp; Yes that's right!&nbsp; Even if you work for yourself and work from home, you can take a day off.&nbsp; I strongly recommend that you do what an HR department does -- make a policy like "I get 5 days off per year" and then keep track of it.&nbsp; At the end of the year if you haven't taken all your days off, roll them into the next year.&nbsp; This is a really good way to remind yourself that you have this kind of option.  
  
12. **Take Your Holidays**.&nbsp; When you work from home, you tend not to take your holidays.&nbsp; You often don't even notice them!&nbsp; I know that we celebrate Columbus Day in this country but I'm not certain of the month anymore.&nbsp; I haven't taken a Columbus day off since 1998.&nbsp; That's bad.&nbsp; Go into Outlook, put in the holidays (and why, why, why aren't they in there by default?) and actually schedule an event for those days.&nbsp; Don't even be at home or you'll just work.&nbsp; Take it from an expert.

So there you have it: 12 tips for separating work and home when you work from home.&nbsp; It remains to be seen, however, if I will ever take my own advice....
