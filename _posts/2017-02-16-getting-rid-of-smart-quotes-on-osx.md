I don't know about any other developer but I bloody well hate smart quotes.  I'm sorry but if I type in a "foo" mark then I expect it to remain "foo" not some bastardized quote version that is going to get messed up into curly quotes when I copy and pasted.  I have long that this was either application behavior or behind the scenes OSX behavior that I was doomed to forever have to cope with.

In reading a [Hacker News thread on Amazon Chime](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13641301), I found out that wasn't true: 

> If you are on OSX, that is a feature of OSX, not Slack. You can turn it off in Keyboard settings IIRC. [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13644973)

When I went to do this myself though I couldn't find it initially so here's the whole flow:

# Start at the Apple Menu

# Now You're At System Preferences

# Now You're At Keyboard

# Now You Select Text

# Now You Turn off the Use Smart Quotes and Dashes Checkbox

And the final step is to close out of System Preferences which should automatically save your settings
