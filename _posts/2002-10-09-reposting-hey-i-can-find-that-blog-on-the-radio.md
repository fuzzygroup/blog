<p>(I know it's bad form to repost an entire entry but this happens today so I thought it appropriate.&nbsp; I hope you can tune in; I suspect that it's short, probably only 10 minutes or so).</p>
<p>I wrote that title with the deepest apologies to REM.&nbsp; Sorry guys but it seemed the perfect lead in to letting folks know that if you listen to AnchorDesk's David Coursey on CNET Radio, I'll be interviewed about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013031121/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596003889/qid=1033557908/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/002-4202734-9602408?v=glance&amp;n=507846"><strong><font color="#4c80ad" size="2">O'Reilly's Essential Blogging</font></strong></a> on next Wednesday, 10/9, at 12:00 pm PST.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can&nbsp;find it at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013031121/http://www.cnetradio.com/"><strong><font color="#345877" size="2">CNET Radio</font></strong></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The real topic is&nbsp;Essential Blogging but I suspect that it will also cover basic blogging questions (and why to blog) and comments on tools.</p>
