<font size="+1"><b>Very, Very Practical Tips for the Busy Person</b></font>

I don't know about you but I am busy.&nbsp; Very busy.&nbsp; And, if you don't want to make mistakes when you are busy, you need help.&nbsp; Over the past many years, I have found that these tips really help me quite a bit.&nbsp; Listed below are 10 tips for busy people.&nbsp; You'll laugh and some are silly perhaps but I use most of them every single day.

1. **Auto Start an Editor**.&nbsp; For the past 10 years or so (ever since multiple processes on an Intel box worked), I've had a startup command that equates to "NOTEPAD C:\TODO.TXT".&nbsp; I always have an editor open so I can jot down todos, phone 3#s, etc.&nbsp; Tremendously helpful.&nbsp; Yes I use Outlook too but this is faster and easier a lot of the time. 
2. **Velcro**.&nbsp; I've been a huge velcro fan for years.&nbsp; Here's why -- It keeps me from losing stuff.&nbsp; Here's an example.&nbsp; I have a velcro patch on my phone.&nbsp; And then a matching velcro patch on my monitor.&nbsp; Net result?&nbsp; I tend not to lose my phone (or my pager, my stapler, my X -- a picture of my monitor would make you just laugh).&nbsp; What?&nbsp; You never lost your cordless phone?&nbsp; Good for you. 
3. **Save Everything**.&nbsp; Always, Always, Always Save Every: Phone Number, Birthday, Email Address, Emergency Contact #, etc.&nbsp; Calling the "I'm at my girl friend's" number has let me find engineers with less than perfect quality, the night before a build is due more than once.&nbsp; Every birthday should go right into a calendar.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; It makes people feel good when they are remembered.&nbsp; 
4. **Put it In Your Shoes**.&nbsp; If you need to do something and it's really important?&nbsp; Then put a reminder in your shoes.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; You generally put your shoes on and this forces you to see it.&nbsp; Alternative: Put it in front of the door by which you leave the house. 
5. **Two Alarm Clocks**.&nbsp; Yup.&nbsp; Two.&nbsp; Always have 2.&nbsp; Safer. 
6. **Passport**.&nbsp; Always leave it in the same place.&nbsp; Never, ever move it.&nbsp; For me, it's always in my laptop bag.&nbsp; Just safer (and really useful when your wallet is stolen and you need ID). 
7. **The Emergency $20**.&nbsp; Go to the ATM.&nbsp; Get out $20.&nbsp; Stick it in a back pocket in your wallet.&nbsp; Then get out another $20 and put it in the glove compartment of your car.&nbsp; It's saved me more than once. 
8. **Phone Headset on a Cordless Phone**.&nbsp; I multitask furiously on a PC -- and in real life.&nbsp; Since I work from home, you just don't know where I am and what I'm doing when we talk on the phone.&nbsp; I've been known to (quietly) wander around my yard while talking to clients.&nbsp; Or do other things.&nbsp; A headset makes this possible.&nbsp; Recommended.&nbsp; NOTE: Expensive headsets aren't needed.&nbsp; I use a $5 headset. 
9. **Buy 2 Not 1**.&nbsp; Whenever I run out of a personal consumable item -- Toothpaste, Advil, Toilet Paper, etc., I replace it by buying 2.&nbsp; Saves tons of time -- and lots of embarrassment. 
10. **General Rule: Make it Easy and Simple**.&nbsp; Trust me on this one -- if something isn't easy and simple, you probably just won't do it.&nbsp; Think about backup for example -- unless it's really easy, people just don't do it.&nbsp; Think about blogging: We all do it, in large part, because it's easy and simple.  
  
And, now, the additions from readers.&nbsp; Thanks guys!  
  
11. From [www.natrak.net](http://www.natrak.net) : Make sure you have at least one spare fully charged laptop for your laptop when on the road. 
12. From [www.natrak.net](http://www.natrak.net/) : When managing developers, always, always keep some food and drinks on hand.&nbsp; This keeps developers working, not leaving the office.&nbsp; Cheaper in the long run.
13. <font size="2">
<p>From <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0106954/">Massimo</a>: Always take something to read when you go out. You never know you may end up in a line or queue. I usually print articles from Internet magazine.</p></font>
