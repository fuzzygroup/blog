<p>Seeing all the astonishing prices on home electronics over this Thanksgiving holiday has given my wife and I the incentive to "make our contribution to the global economy" with the purchase of a big screen TV.  We're debating between a 32" LCD to a 42" plasma tv in the $1,500 to $2,000 price range.  We're thinking about the <a href="http://froogle.google.com/froogle?q=sharp+aquos+32&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search+Froogle&amp;lmode=unknown&amp;sl=on">Sharp Aquos</a> but wondered if anyone had any input.  Thanks in advance.</p>
