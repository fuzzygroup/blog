**Disapproving cat finds Time Machine annoying**

Embarrassingly for a computer professional, I spent much of the past 12 months with a personal laptop that wasn't backed up.  And I don't mean "I backed it up infrequently", I mean there was no backup -- period.  I use OSX and Time Machine would simply churn on "Preparing Backup" for days on end -- one time I even let it run for a full weekend -- to no avail.

I even followed all the [LifeWire tips](https://www.lifewire.com/troubleshoot-time-machine-stuck-on-preparing-backup-2259980) and still nothing.  

What solved it was finally almost running out of space and discovering that I had a single directory of files that contained almost 552 gigabytes of crawl data from my failed Udemy misadventure.  Sigh.  Deleting all that data magically made Time Machine work again.
