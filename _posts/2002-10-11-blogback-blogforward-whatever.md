<p>Today's post, brought to you by the random IM interactions from the fine folks over at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013031121/http://kalsey.com/blog/">Kalsey Group</a> (why?&nbsp; Not sure, he was just the last person I IM'd with before crashing last night) will be a little bit different. Rather than my long rants on different topics, today I'll blog just lots and lots of little tidbits.</p>
<p>The Kalsey Group points out that the Amazon API lets you sort electronics by price and that while I attribute their lack of price sorting to maliciousness, it might just be "plain shoddy management".&nbsp; I'd agree with that. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013031121/http://kalsey.com/blog/2002/10/sorting_amazon.stm">[ Go ]</a></p>
<p>If you still believe that email marketing works (I don't) then you might want to read the Kalsey Group's essay on it.&nbsp; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013031121/http://kalsey.com/blog/2002/09/email_marketing_usability.stm">[ Go ]</a></p>
<p>Best Blog of the Week?&nbsp; IASlash which covers a range of Knowledge Management issues and never fails to impress me.&nbsp; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013031121/http://www.iaslash.org/">[ Go ]</a> </p>
<p>The blogger who has lost his way and needs to blog more?&nbsp; Kjartan over at Natrak.net.&nbsp; Please come home man.&nbsp; We miss you.&nbsp; (No go link since he's not updating all that regularly as of late).</p>
<p>Ray Ozzie has an excellent essay about "What If There Was No Privacy in (work) Email".&nbsp; It's an interesting question and one that I think about all the time.&nbsp; I do think his essay is, unforunately, totally self serving since the only privacy alternative to email he suggests is a Groove Space.&nbsp; Come on man.&nbsp; People can also have "privacy" with just a Hotmail account.&nbsp; Yes it's not encrypted but that's not a big deal.&nbsp; The bigger issue with privacy in work email is the communications between you and your friends / family / significant others that gets mixed in.&nbsp; Requiring employees to NOT use their work email account for this is a much simpler alternative to a Groove space.&nbsp; No client software, no training, no costs to the company.&nbsp; Note to Ray Ozzie: We all know Groove is good but you don't always need to be a schill for your product.&nbsp; And I'm gonna take flame from the Groove boys on this one.&nbsp; So be it.&nbsp; Asbestos boxer shorts at the ready.&nbsp; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013031121/http://www.ozzie.net/blog/2002/10/08.html">[ Go ]</a></p>
<p>JabberCentral is shutting down.&nbsp; That's a shame so go over there if you need any of it's resources.&nbsp; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013031121/http://www.jabbercentral.org/">[ Go ]</a></p>
<p>The Microsoft HTML Help Workshop?&nbsp; It sucks slimy green toads.&nbsp; Let's just say that recently I ran out of disc space and the culprit was a 1.7 gigabyte temp file that this little odious troll of a program left behind when compiling a 1.4 meg help file.&nbsp; No there are no errors on those #s.&nbsp; Check the picture. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013031121/http://radio.weblogs.com/0103807/images/thetempfilefromhell.gif">[ Go ]</a></p>
<p>Thanks to my friend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013031121/http://guy.blogs.at/">Guy Haas</a> for translating "Who Benefits" into latin for a future blog essay.&nbsp; He used google to do it.&nbsp; And not the Google translation feature.&nbsp; It's "Cui Bono".&nbsp; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013031121/http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;q=%22latin+for%22+%22who+benefits%22">[ Go ]</a></p>
<p>Shame on Jakob Nielsen.&nbsp; I have nothing but respect for Jakob, who is a really sweet guy; I met him back in the ACM Hypertext 9X conference days when he was still at Sun, but Useit.com is getting misleading.&nbsp; Here's the text I'm referencing.</p>

<p><a class="new" title="Nielsen Norman Group: report description and purchase" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013031121/http://www.nngroup.com/reports/intranet/2002/">158-page Intranet Design Annual with 104 screenshots</a> of the ten winners is available for download. </p></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">It would be nice if he pointed out that "is available for <strong>purchase and</strong> download".&nbsp; I wouldn't have bothered clicking on that link if I knew that in advance.&nbsp; Neither would most people and wouldn't that be more usable?&nbsp; Still Jakob's essays remain excellent and I have huge respect for the man.&nbsp; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013031121/http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20020903.html">[ Go ]</a> </p>

<p dir="ltr">The combination of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013031121/http://news.google.com/">Google News</a> and blogs really does tranform your view of the news.&nbsp; Now this may be a lot more significant for Americans than the rest of the world since we tend to be inward looking.&nbsp; But now when I want to know what's going on in Indonesia, I turn to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013031121/http://joe.weblog.or.id/index.html">Joe</a>.&nbsp; And I feel that Google News has brought me balance by letting&nbsp;me see how&nbsp;news organizations outside the U.S. perceive things.&nbsp; For example I saw a good article in the Sydney&nbsp;World Herald the other day&nbsp;with an alternate perspective on Bush's&nbsp;intelligence. &nbsp;While some of us may argue about whether or not Google news is needed or if it's as good as a personal aggregator, I can't see how it's anything but positive.&nbsp; Sure I can't add my own feeds but that's NOT what's for.&nbsp; It's a global newspaper that's always updated.&nbsp; Even in this age of the Internet, newspapers are still useful.&nbsp; Google News is just a 21st century version. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013031121/http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/10/09/1034061257034.html">[ Go ]</a></p>
