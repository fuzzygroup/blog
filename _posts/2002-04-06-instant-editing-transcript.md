fuzzygroup: Got a sec?  
guykhaas: Yup  
fuzzygroup: I did a quick glossary this am that you might want to look at  
guykhaas: And its URL is  
fuzzygroup: Sorry same as faq which is:   
fuzzygroup: [http://www.fuzzygroup.com/writing/radiouserland\_faq.htm](http://www.fuzzygroup.com/writing/radiouserland_faq.htm)  
guykhaas: Awwwww......&nbsp; I'm eyeballing the glossary.  
guykhaas: "Cloud

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The somewhat abstract area out on the Internet where all your information is stored  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the server actually exists. The home page for your weblog is generally considered to  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exist in the "cloud".  
&nbsp;seems to have lost something there somewhere after "stored"  
fuzzygroup: on it.  
fuzzygroup: done  
guykhaas: The blackbullet for term name, white bullet for definition, scheme looks odd.&nbsp; Why bullet the definitions?  
fuzzygroup: it was 5:30 am after 3 hrs sleep  
guykhaas: Unless they have multiple points to make.  
guykhaas: 's OK....&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm just askin'&nbsp; :-)  
fuzzygroup: i just fixing!  
guykhaas: "yoru information" -- in the revised "cloud"  
fuzzygroup: done.  
fuzzygroup: tableizing it now  
guykhaas: Item

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A single discrete \<word missing\> of information on your weblog.   
fuzzygroup: unit but fixed now  
guykhaas: In macro, you're talking about the definition and the invocation of a macro.&nbsp; The "small programming subroutne" is the definition.....the \<%title%\> is the invocation.&nbsp; Might polish that a tad.  
fuzzygroup: oh yes  
guykhaas: Still crusing along, Good Stuff.  
fuzzygroup: Good.  
fuzzygroup: It does make sense kinda.... sorta... stay out of radio.exe though  
guykhaas: Post.&nbsp;&nbsp; This lost the distinction between Publish and Post I saw elsewhere.  
fuzzygroup: I guess I missed that.  
fuzzygroup: No I know.&nbsp; Depends on how radio is configed  
guykhaas: At 5:50 a.m.&nbsp; gee, why?&nbsp; :-)  
fuzzygroup: Couldn't sleep  
guykhaas: Not why working at 5:30 -- why should I expect that you would not bobble a bit  
fuzzygroup: Oh yeah.  
fuzzygroup: I churned out about 2500 words in an hour and a half and then fed it thru word to fix the numerous grammar errors.&nbsp; Code examples were right though....  
guykhaas: Jeez  
guykhaas: Brain dump  
fuzzygroup: Total core dump.  
guykhaas: You running old technology?&nbsp; :-)  
guykhaas: Core?  
fuzzygroup: I had just solved a php problem (localization) yesterday so the solution was crisp -- had to get it out.  
fuzzygroup: You should know core  
guykhaas: Yeah, but today's folk.......&nbsp;&nbsp;   
... (we went off topic here)

guykhaas: Back to my glossary scan.  
guykhaas: "Templates can be modified" --\> "You can modify your templates"  
fuzzygroup: on it  
guykhaas: "calendar"  
fuzzygroup: need to learn to pay attention to red squiggly  
guykhaas: Themes \<word?\> all the presentation of your weblog  
fuzzygroup: done  
guykhaas: "revised with just one command" is ambiguous.  
guykhaas: jeez, real-time editing is cool.  
fuzzygroup: Isn't it?  
fuzzygroup: This is really neat.  
guykhaas: I feel like a back-seat editor.  
fuzzygroup: well phrased  
guykhaas: I'm down at XML-RPC.&nbsp; you ARE going to make the URL links live, right?  
fuzzygroup: Yes.&nbsp; Fpage barfed on it.  
guykhaas: No d'oh!  
fuzzygroup: I mean this morning  
guykhaas: I'm sure somebody could kvetch about your offhand explanation of XML, but in this context I think it's a good shot.  
fuzzygroup: Oh yes.  
fuzzygroup: Even I winced but for this audience, its fine.  
guykhaas: Egg zacktly.&nbsp; Know Your Audience.  
fuzzygroup: Oh yes.  
fuzzygroup: Somehow if I pulled out a w3c spec or iso docs, they'd run for the hills
