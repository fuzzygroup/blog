[Tonsky](https://tonsky.me/blog/monitors/) recently had a great post about 4K monitors, fonts and scaling.  The magic in this article are his suggestions around how to set fonts on your OSX machine.  Apparently Apple does not set the defaults correctly (and, I'm writing this on a brand new OSX box that is NOTABLY improved by following his directions).  This is the kind of stuff that I'm going to need to refer back to hence this post.  [Discussion thread about this](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23551983).
