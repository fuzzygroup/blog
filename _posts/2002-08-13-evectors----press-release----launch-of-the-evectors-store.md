<h4>Evectors, Srl, an Italian Content Management Vendor Forms North American Subsidiary to Launch IdeaTools a Leading Content Management System</h4>
</center>

* * *

**Trieste, Italy / Belmont, MA. -- July 18, 2002 --** Taking a large step forward, a leading Italian software company, Evectors Srl, today announced the formal opening of their new North American division, eVectors North America.&nbsp; Evectors is a 10 year old Italian software and services company focused on web content management software and design, consulting and application development services.&nbsp; With the formal launch of a new North American division, eVectors is now able to offer their award winning product and services, IdeaTools, to a much larger audience.

#### Evectors IdeaTools: a Scalable Content Management Solution

Evectors originated as a multimedia developer and creator of websites in the early 1990s.&nbsp; Over time, as customer needs coalesced around a common set of themes, eVectors made a strategic decision to enter the software business by developing a content management platform, IdeaTools.&nbsp; Since that early point, IdeaTools has evolved into a robust, scalable content management solution, now at version 2.5 and in use on over 160 different web sites.&nbsp; Organizations using IdeaTools range from Pharmacia, the largest pharmaceutical company in the world right down to individual merchants such as Active-Software an Italian eCommerce site that sells software over the Internet.&nbsp; Key features include:

- Complete operation of all features using a web browser from any desktop in the world - no complicated software to install and no need for obscure scripting languages 
- Support for integrated intranet / extranet sites using one product, one content database and one security architecture 
- Discussion groups 
- Full support for even cutting edge web features such as XSLT, RSS and XML 
- An underlying object database that manages all content 
- A powerful theme system 
- Content Versioning Support 
- Integral News Aggregator

#### Expansion: Even in Bad Economic Times

Given the current economic climate, many companies are focusing on cutting expenses and not even trying to expand.&nbsp; Whena asked about this, Paolo Valdemerin, the founder and CEO of Evectors commented:

> _It's certainly true that we aren't in the best times for expansion but I and my board of directors made the decision that our product offers compelling advantages for all companies -- even in bad times so the expansion made sense.&nbsp; The powerful templating and site creation features in IdeaTools can help companies create web sites more efficiently -- and at a fraction of the time and cost of competing products.&nbsp; We think that even in a down market, particularly in a down market, this is a compelling reason to purchase._
#### Blogging and How it Affects Business Partnerships

Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the eVectors expansion is that it grew out of the blogging world -- and is occurring approximately 6 to 9 months earlier than planned.&nbsp; Here's what happened from the perspective of J. Scott Johnson, VP of Marketing for North America:

> _Paolo and I are both regular bloggers and two of the most successful bloggers within our blogging community ([metrics](http://subhonker6.userland.com/rcsPublic/ranking) - Scott is "FuzzyBlog" and Paolo is "Paolo's Weblog").&nbsp; We met through our mutual blogs as we write on similar subjects.&nbsp; After a number of online discussions and cross linking, Paolo approached me about taking charge of the North American expansion.&nbsp; One week later, I and our VP of Business Development, were on a plane to Italy.&nbsp; The most interesting aspect of this is that we did it sight unseen, no personal interaction at all and without having discussed compensation.&nbsp; That's the level of trust that blogging inspires.&nbsp; Compare this with traditional approaches to finding staff, recruiting and creating a subsidiary._
