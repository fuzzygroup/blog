<font size="+1"><b>Marketing 101: Making Money from a Website: PHPBeginner Case Study</b></font>

We all want to make money from our website.&nbsp; Making money from a website is \_\_hard\_\_.&nbsp; This article talks about a few ways that one website that I am quite familiar with, [www.phpbeginner.com](http://www.phpbeginner.com), might choose to make money from their site.

**DISCLAIMER:** I'm an author for [www.phpbeginner.com](http://www.phpbeginner.com) as well as someone that considers Maxim (the founder of the site) a friend.&nbsp; This was written, however, not for him but as a critical way to examine this all too important and overlooked topic.

### Traditional Money Making Tools for Websites

The two traditional money making tools for web sites we know and find all too ineffective include:

- Advertisements 
- E-Commerce Referral Links

I know quite a few people that have sites, that get real traffic,&nbsp;that have tried both of these options and found them lacking.&nbsp; So what we are going to do is return to the very, very basics and examine this topic in view of those basics.

### Question 1: What Do You Own?

You can't make money unless you own something.&nbsp; If you own something then, perhaps:

- Someone might want to buy it 
- Someone might want to rent it 
- You might want to sell it (not everything you own is something that you are willing to sell).

This brings us to the question of what a website might own.&nbsp; Typical assets a web site "owns" include:

- Content i.e. the information on the&nbsp;web site 
- Readers (not really ownership) i.e. a group of people that come back regularly or somewhat regularly 
- Authors i.e. the people that create the content for the site 
- Metrics i.e. the data about the audience.&nbsp; Market research data can be quite valuable to the right person. 
- Interactive Services i.e. HotMail is an interactive service.&nbsp; So is MapQuest.

### Question 2: What Are You Selling?

So now the question becomes that out of the possible items that you own, what are you willing to sell.

&nbsp;

For most web sites I would stongly urge them to consider implementing a self service ad sales system.&nbsp;

### Question 3: Who's Willing to Buy It?

&nbsp;

### Question 4: Can you be an Intermediary?

Question 5: Can Your Costs Be Cut Dramatically?
