I am not a front end engineer -- but I'm on a project right now with heavy front end requirements.  This blog post documents how I got Font Awesome running on by application including the brands extension.  It is by no means a great way to do it and I know:

* I have more overhead than needed
* I did not take advantage of Rails 7 facilities in the best way
* This skips the gem so you lose another dependency from Gemfile
* I made this work and I sort of understand it but if you asked me to explain it, I think I'd fail the class.  Today I wanted to do nothing more than display a github icon.  And it does that.

Still this works and it is conceptually simple.

**NOTE**: I full well expect to return to this and figure out the "right" way to do this.  However, I'm in heavy greenfield development mode and the desire to simply make it work and GIVE ME MY DAMN ICONS **NOW** is the paramount concern.  In greenfield development mode, nothing is more important than:

1. Productivity / not getting bogged down.
2. Not getting discouraged when trying to do something that should be simple (display a damn icon).  So much of modern front end development is just plain ridiculously complicated for simple things like making a font work or displaying an image.

## Font Awesome Steps

1. Download Font Awesome Locally and Decompress It.  This requires an [account](https://fontawesome.com/account) I think.
2. Move stylesheets/all.css to app/assets/stylesheets/
3. Move webfonts (directory and all) to public/ (yes public)
4. Add **//= link all.css** to manifest.js
5. In config/initializers/assets.rb add: **Rails.application.config.assets.paths << Rails.root.join("assets/webfonts")** (yes that isn't the right path but it still works; who knows???)
6. In application.html.erb you need to make one change.

This code:

    <%= stylesheet_link_tag "all"%>

Here's an example of the html to use to generate a font:

    <i class="fas fa-github"></i>
    <i class="fas fa-camera"></i>
    
## Sidebar: How to Add Bootstrap Icons Also

This set of steps let you add the Bootstrap 5 icons to the mix also and is based on the same initializer above.

1. Download the webfonts to your computer.
2. Unzip the directory.
3. Move the files from the fonts directory to public/webfonts.  There should be 2 files: public/webfonts/bootstrap-icons.woff and public/webfonts/bootstrap-icons.woff2
4. Move the css file from the zip i.e bootstrap-icons.css to app/assets/stylesheets
5. Add a stylesheet link tag to application.html.erb for bootstrap-icons.css
6. Edit the bootstrap-icons.css file to reflect the pathing for your webfonts.  Originally mine had ./fonts as the initial path.  I had to change it to ./webfonts

Stylesheet link tag example:

    <%= stylesheet_link_tag "bootstrap-icons"%> 

Test your bootstrap webfonts with code like this:

    <i class="bi-alarm"></i>
    <i class="bi-alarm" style="font-size: 2rem; color: cornflowerblue;"></i>

application_helper method to generate the right formatting:

```ruby
def font_icon(icon_name, icon_style='fas', style='')
  extra = ''
  if style
    extra = " style='#{style}'"
  end
  if icon_name =~ /^bi-/
    formatting_string = "<i class='#{icon_name} #{extra}'></i>"
  else
    formatting_string = "<i class='#{icon_style} fa-#{icon_name}' #{extra}'></i>"
  end
  # NOTE: Turn off the .html_safe method for debugging purposes
  return formatting_string.html_safe
end
```

Text to drop into a .html.erb template file to see if it works:

    # 1. <%=font_icon('bi-github')%><br/>
    # 2. <%=font_icon('github')%><br/>
    # 3. <%=font_icon('bi-github')%><br/>
    # 4. <%=font_icon('github', 'fab', "font-size: 2rem; color: cornflowerblue;")%><br/>
    # 5. <%=font_icon('bi-github','', "font-size: 2rem; color: cornflowerblue;")%><br/>
