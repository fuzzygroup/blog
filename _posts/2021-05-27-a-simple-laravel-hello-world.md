As of late I've been working in Laravel and figuring out how Laravel differs from Rails.  And while I have a bigger blog post in the works, I thought there was learning value in a simple Hello World implemented in Laravel.  Hello World is a simple program that just puts Hello World on the screen. 

Here's how I thought a Laravel version of this should work:

* Be a whole Laravel application
* Be a single controller
* Be a single route
* Define the text "Hello World" as a variable, $text, in the controller
* Display that on the screen via an HTML template

While this doesn't illustrated models and database connectivity, this actually illustrates how to use a surprising amount of an overall MVC framework.  

## Step 1: Creating an Application

The first step is to use composer to generate the overall application with:

    composer create-project laravel/laravel hello_world

The next step is to change into the directory with:

    cd hello_world
    
and then open the code base with:

    mate .

or if you use Sublime:

    subl .

## Step 2: Generating a Controller

Back at your command line, you want to generate a controller with:

    php artisan make:controller HelloController

This will create a file named HelloController in app/http/Controllers:

    ls -l app/Http/Controllers
    total 16
    -rw-r--r--  1 sjohnson  staff  361 May 18 11:37 Controller.php
    -rw-r--r--  1 sjohnson  staff  122 May 27 09:12 HelloController.php

Inside the controller you want to add the following code (some of which will already be there from the generator):

```php
    public function index()
     {
         return view('hello_index');
     } 
```

inside the "class HelloController extends Controller" block of code (it goes inside the {} braces).

## Step 3: Adding a Route

Moving back to the code base, you want to edit the file routes/web.php and add this line:

```php
Route::get('/hello', 'App\Http\Controllers\HelloController@index');
```

This adds a single route, /hello, which is then handled by the Hello controller and the hello_index action.

You can test that this route is available by running:

    php artisan route:list

which should show you something like this:

    +--------+----------+----------+------+--------------------------------------------+------------+
    | Domain | Method   | URI      | Name | Action                                     | Middleware |
    +--------+----------+----------+------+--------------------------------------------+------------+
    |        | GET|HEAD | /        |      | Closure                                    | web        |
    |        | GET|HEAD | api/user |      | Closure                                    | api        |
    |        |          |          |      |                                            | auth:api   |
    |        | GET|HEAD | hello    |      | App\Http\Controllers\HelloController@index | web        |
    +--------+----------+----------+------+--------------------------------------------+------------+

**Note**: It is critical that you use the fully name spaced path to the controller (i.e. starting with **App**).  According to what I've read, you can use a use declaration at the top of the routes file to import controllers so you don't have to have the name spacing everywhere but I was unable to ever make that work.

## Step 4: Adding a Variable to the Controller

Inside the public function index method of the Hello controller, you want to add / change the following code:

```php
$text = "Hello Cruel World";
return view('hello_index', ['text' => $text]);
```

This defines one variable, $text, which should then be available in the view.  The way that it becomes available to the view is by passing a hash into the return statement which has a key of 'text' which is mapped to the variable $text.

## Step 5: Creating a View and Displaying a Variable

Views, in Laravel, live in the directory resources/views so you can create one with the command:

    touch resources/views/hello_index.blade.php

And you then want to edit that file and add this code:

    <h1>{{ $text }}</h1>

## Step 6: Previewing the Results

The key command here is:

    php artisan serve
    
which starts the application and displays the result on:

    http://localhost:8000/hello
    
At which point you should see "Hello World" come onto the screen.

## Conclusion

This gives a fully functional Hello World application implemented in Laravel.  I didn't focus on differences from Rails here in order to simplify this post.  In my next post, I'll do more of that.
