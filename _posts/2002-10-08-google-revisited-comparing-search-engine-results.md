<p>With the recent change in Google's ranking (and, in apologies to Mark Pilgrim, I now think Google has some real errors in the new ranking when I didn't think so before, but it's still not as bad as some are making it out to be), I thought it might be interesting to look at how Google compares for a specitic search with other engines.&nbsp; And I picked a query that has relevance to me -- <strong>Scott Johnson</strong>.&nbsp; No quotes, no phrases, just those two words (except for AllTheWeb which gets a special mention for automatically adding quotes).&nbsp; All I'm measuring is not which page comes up first but where a page that is related to me comes up.&nbsp; Sometimes it's a page from my website, sometimes it's a blog page and sometimes it's my O'Reilly book catalog entry.&nbsp; </p>

<p>What's really interesting here is that almost all of this is almost certainly related to my blog.&nbsp; I didn't have anywhere near these kind of results before I was a blogger.&nbsp; It's also extremely interesting to me the similarities between Google, Teoma, Wisenut and Alta Vista.&nbsp; That's just plain shocking to me.&nbsp; True the comparison isn't entirely valid since they result in different pages at times but these searches all give results related to me.</p>
<p>Lessons From All This</p>
<p>There are two easy lessons from all this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right now the single best search engine optimization technique?&nbsp; A simple weblog.&nbsp; And I know that Google seems to treat radio.weblogs.com as a highly valid source of input so I recommend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013031121/http://radio.userland.com/">Radio</a>.&nbsp; But I think it really matters that you blog regularly and somewhat consistently.&nbsp; 
<li>Don't spend exorbitant fees on search engine optimization.&nbsp; As ranking algorithms have gotten much more complex without explicit, inside knowledge of how the engines work it is very unclear to me that it works at all anymore.&nbsp; I suspect that you'll get dramatically better results by becoming a blogger.</li></ol>
