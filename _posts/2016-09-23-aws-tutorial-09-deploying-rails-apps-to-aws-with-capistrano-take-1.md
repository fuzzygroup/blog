title: AWS Tutorial 09 - Deploying Rails Apps With Capistrano Take 1
category: aws
tags: ["ruby", "rails", "aws", "capistrano", "deploy"]

In this tutorial we're going to use the latest version of Capistrano to deploy your Rails app onto one or more EC2 instances.  I'm dividing this tutorial into two parts:

* Take 1 where a static set of boxes is encoded into your deploy/production.rb file
* Take 2 where we call AWS apis to figure out what boxes to deploy to

The reason for separating them is that take 2 will bring us much deeper into AWS API programming and concepts like tagging / IAM roles I wanted that to be highly separate from the guts of Capistrano.

# Tools

In this tutorial I'm going to be specific to:

* Capistrano
* Passenger
* Bundler
* RVM

That's my standard Rails stack and while other configurations will work, NGINX is a favorite of people, that's the only stack I personally understand end to end.

# Getting Started - Add Capistrano to Your Gemfile

You're going to want to use Capistrano 3.6 or later.  Earlier versions of Capistrano should work but, in my experience, Capistrano 3.6 is a much better release - it took me away from Vlad finally and for that I was glad.  

If your Gemfile you want something like this:

    group :development do
      # Use Capistrano for deployment
      gem 'capistrano', "3.6.1"
      gem 'capistrano3-puma'
      gem 'capistrano-rails', require: false
      gem 'capistrano-bundler', require: false
      gem 'capistrano-rvm'
      gem 'capistrano-passenger'
    end

After that you want to run bundle install:

    bundle install
    
As long as this runs correctly you should be fine to move onto the next step.

# Run the Cap install Command

Capistrano requires a one time setup step.  Do this now:

    Cap install
    
This generates a file in the root of your Rails app called Capfile.  Open that file and uncomment these lines:

    require 'capistrano/rvm'
    require 'capistrano/bundler'
    require 'capistrano/rails/assets'    

# Modify config/deploy.rb 

The file config/deploy.rb covers the application level configuration for deployment. In this file you need to add lines like the ones below but specific to your code base / toolset:

    set :application, 'banks'
    set :repo_url, 'git@github.com:appdatallc/banks.git'
    
    set :ssh_options, {
      forward_agent: true,
      auth_methods: ["publickey"],
      keys: ["#{Dir.home}/.ssh/fi_nav_sitecrawl.pem"]
    }
    
    set :deploy_to, '/var/www/apps/banks'
    

# Modifying config/deploy/production.rb

The file config/deploy/production.rb covers the servers you are deploying to in the production environment. If you're setting up a staging server then there is a similar file in config/deploy/staging.rb.

Before you start does this section I strongly, strong, strongly advice you to read my [AWS Tutorial on the SSH Config file](https://fuzzygroup.github.io/blog/aws/2016/09/20/aws-tutorial-08-using-ssh-s-config-file-with-your-aws-boxes.html).  You can use the approach in that file to identify your boxes.  If you do then this line:

    server 'ec2-52-41-237-52.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com', user: 'ubuntu', roles: %w{web app}

would be replaced by this line:

    server 'ficrawler1', roles: %w{web app}
    
Not only is this simpler to understand but it centralizes all your EC2 machine addresses in one place.  That's a huge win.

Regardless of the approach you decide to take, you need one line in this file for each EC2 instance along with the roles the instance provides.

# Doing a Deploy

Once all of this configured then you should be able to do a:

    cap production deploy
    
to get your current code base onto all your boxes.  Please keep in mind that Capistrano executes everything via SSH and it generates a long stream of commands.  If you see errors then there are two things to understand:

* Not every error may be significant and need to be addressed
* If you are trying to track down an error then I would strongly recommend reducing the boxes you deploy to to just one and then redeploying.  This is much easier to troubleshoot exactly what is happening
