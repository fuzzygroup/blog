# Radio Userland Part 1 or "I'm a Moron..."

* * *

<font size="2"><b>Looking Out from Cliveden Castle, England</b></font>

**Disclaimer** :&nbsp;  
Having had my breakthrough, I'm now a happy&nbsp;  
Radio user and figuring it out.&nbsp; [Here's the proof](http://radio.weblogs.com/0103807/).

Disclaimer #2:  
I'm so happy with Radio that tutorial #2 is&nbsp;  
up.&nbsp; Check out [here](http://fuzzygroup.net/writing/radiouserland_part02.htm) for it.

### I'm Not a Moron, Really...

For the past six years or so, I've read Dave Winer's [www.scripting.com](http://www.scripting.com/) newsletter regularly and when the whole Weblogging thing started, I was definitely intrigued.&nbsp; People I know and respect, such as Russ Lipton, write weblogs regularly and I really, really wanted to start.&nbsp;

But, and isn't there always a but, every time I downloaded Radio, I kept hitting problems.&nbsp; The simple fact that I'm still using FrontPage to write this says more than anything else.&nbsp; Radio is supposed to be easier than FrontPage.&nbsp; Still, this morning, I had a break through, a flash of blinding light that was just dazzling.&nbsp; Hence this essay...

### Here's My Problem

There is a new thing in the Radio world called "Instant Outlining".&nbsp; I don't get it yet but I've been an outline user ever since Ready (and that's 86ish) and before.&nbsp; So I wanted to use this.&nbsp; I bought a Radio license -- best to be legal -- and tried to get started.&nbsp; Here are the directions from: [http://radio.outliners.com/instantoutlinerdownload](http://radio.outliners.com/instantoutlinerdownload)

**<font face="Times New Roman">How to install</font><font face="Times New Roman"> </font>[<font face="Times New Roman"><img height="9" src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" width="11" border="0"></font>](http://fuzzygroup.net/writing/radiouserland_part01.htm#howToInstall "Permanent link to 'How to install' in archive.")**<font face="Times New Roman"><br><br>1. Download and expand the install package: </font>[<font face="Times New Roman">Windows</font>](http://static.userland.com/gems/radiooutliners/InstantOutlinerInstaller.zip)<font face="Times New Roman">, </font>[<font face="Times New Roman">Macintosh</font>](http://static.userland.com/gems/radiooutliners/InstantOutlinerInstaller.sit)<font face="Times New Roman">.<br><br>2. Bring the Radio application to the front.<br><br>3. Choose the Open command from the File menu in the Radio application. Open the install script, installInstantOutliner.ftds.<br><br>4. A confirmation dialog appears. Click on OK, to update Radio.root and install the Instant Outliner parts.</font>

### What I Learned

Now, this is what makes me think that I am a moron.&nbsp; When you run Radio from the Program Files menu, you get a screen that looks like this:

![](http://fuzzygroup.net/writing/images/radiou5.jpg)

It's a browser.&nbsp; Nothing wrong with browser centric apps.&nbsp; I write them myself and it is a fundamentally better way to write products.&nbsp; Browsers make better interfaces period (but that's another story).&nbsp; Anyway, here's what drove me nuts:

<font face="Times New Roman">3. Choose the Open command from the File menu in the Radio application. Open the install script, installInstantOutliner.ftds.</font>

What File menu?&nbsp; I went through every hyperlink looking for a File menu.&nbsp; Since you can easily make menus with dhtml, this isn't unreasonable.&nbsp; Then I installed on another box thinking that it was a software glitch.&nbsp; No luck.&nbsp; Then I noticed the little Radio icon on the status bar:

![](http://fuzzygroup.net/writing/images/radiou6.gif)

Whenever I double clicked it, I got the Radio browser window above.&nbsp; Then, I had the insight flash.&nbsp; What about a right click menu.&nbsp; I tried it and then I got:

![](http://fuzzygroup.net/writing/images/radiou7.gif)

Seeing the Open Radio option, I selected it and then I got:

![](http://fuzzygroup.net/writing/images/radiou8.gif)

Oh my god.&nbsp; There is a File menu!&nbsp; There's a whole application.&nbsp; Now, in Radio's defense, This is probably mentioned somewhere.&nbsp; But, anyone downloading software, particularly cheap software (Radio is $39.95), has the attention span of a rabid gnat.&nbsp; More on that below.&nbsp; They tend to give up immediately when they hit a problem since their investment in the process is minimal at best.&nbsp;

## My Recommendation

I looked at the Radio Userland menu installed into Windows and I saw the following items:

![](http://fuzzygroup.net/writing/images/wpeD.jpg)

The Radio Userland shortcut takes you only to the browser page.&nbsp; Why isn't there a separate Radio Application shortcut?&nbsp; That would have eliminated about 30 minutes of head scratching.

Here is an excerpt from an email that I sent to the makes of Limewire, [www.limewire.com](http://www.limewire.com/), a very, very cool Gnutella application.

Subject: Some thoughts on improving sales of Lime Wire Pro  
  
Hi there,   
  
  
I just downloaded LimeWire and from a basic marketing perspective, I think there are some things that you could do better to increase your user registrations. Here are my thoughts:  
a.. Installation was very good. No errors. I would say you are missing a marketing opportunity here by not display some more info as you install but install is quick so might not be needed.   
**b.. When Yahoo Messenger is first run, it basically forces you thru 6 Wizard like screens that point out why the product is good. Given that download users have the attention span of a rabid gnat, this is very useful. It lets you put your best foot forward and gives the users at least a potential chance of remembering "oh yeah, I think it does that... Now where is it?".**

[Remainder... (not relevant to Radio but interesting, IMHO)](http://fuzzygroup.net/writing/improvinglimewire.htm)  
&nbsp;

Given that I am building software for download right now, you can bet that I'll do this myself.&nbsp; Its a really, really good thing for any application but particularly for downloadable apps.

## Disclaimer

I'm not a moron.&nbsp; Here's my resume: [http://www.fuzzygroup.net/resume.htm](http://www.fuzzygroup.net/resume.htm).&nbsp; I code regularly, know how to administer NT, Exchange and Linux boxes, I've set up SendMail, know SQL, etc.&nbsp; I just had a huge conceptual disconnect with Radio.&nbsp; I still don't understand it very much but the light has dawned...&nbsp;
