A number of years ago, the late [Charles Sheffield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sheffield) had a book titled, I think "Dark as Day", which had as a feature a "fax" which was an AI based  psuedo answering machine that you could chat with when the person you wanted wasn't available: 

> MORD: the idiosyncratic high-level Fax of the late Mordecai Perlman. e-reading.club [More...](https://www.e-reading.club/chapter.php/151398/0/Sheffield_-_Dark_as_Day.html)

And today I read via Hacker News that I can build this using Google CoLab ([article](http://www.svilentodorov.xyz/blog/gpt-15b-chat-finetune/) / [discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22128652)) based on my Facebook Chat data.  Wow.

We really do live in a science fictional universe.  I still want my flying car tho.

**Note**: I don't have a ton to say about this but I find the prospect fascinating and something I want to play with hence the blog post.
