I was in the car with my wife talking to her as I worked and this was the message:

     git commit -m "misc:
    â†’ '''''''''''''''''''vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvV 
    VVVVVVVVVVVVVV                                                               
                              ///////// vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
                              vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
                              vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
                              vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv

I feel asleep while talking to her and coding.  I suspect drooling was also involved.  Too many late nights...
