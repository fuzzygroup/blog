This article discusses "Marketing Your Blog" or "How to Get People to Read Your Blog".&nbsp; It could also be thought of as:

If a blogger blogs and no one reads, did it matter?

The first thing to realize is that the answer to the question above is Yes.&nbsp; Emphatically so.&nbsp; Here's why:

- I take the position that blogging is a conversation, a discourse if you will 
- You can have discourse with yourself (hey, you don't talk to yourself?) 
- Discourse helps clarify your understanding of anything 
- Understanding is good

So, from my perspective, you really want to blog even if no one reads it.&nbsp; It is a useful mental exercise if nothing else.&nbsp;

Still, we are all attention junkies, we want our 15 minutes of fame (or link from [www.scripting.com](http://www.scripting.com)).&nbsp; So, the&nbsp;real question is: **How Do I Market&nbsp;My Blog?** &nbsp; Here is what I do.

1. **I Don't Market It**.&nbsp; Huh?&nbsp; First and foremost you need to understand that blogging is about honesty and truthfullness.&nbsp; Classical marketing is more about "How do I bamboozle the customer into buying what they really don't need?".&nbsp; Marketing a blog is really about building a quality product -- you just do it and then people trip over you.&nbsp; You can accelerate the process somewhat but accept that it takes time. 
2. **Respond to Every Single Comment**.&nbsp; 
3. **Respond to Every Single Email**. 
4. **Be Topically Consistent**. 
5. **Read Other People's Blogs and Leave Comments**. 
6. **Be Audience Appropriate**.&nbsp; 
7. Be High Volume.&nbsp; See my "Secrets of a High Volume Blogger" article.
