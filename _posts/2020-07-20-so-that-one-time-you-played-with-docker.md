So that one time, at band camp -- wait; wrong movie, this is a technical blog post about Docker ...

I recently helped a friend doing some federal work in the medical field get a better understanding of Docker and how Docker can mess about with open source licensing.  We got up a "open source" stack of tooling using a bunch of heavy weight tools:

* Mongo
* Memcached
* A big Python app
* Rabbit MQ

And then, as you so often do, we finished up and I got distracted by the next bit of crazy nerd-fu that runs about in my life (server down; wifi crisis; son needing help with his PC; who can remember) and then I went back to my desk, closed my terminal prompt and never thought much more about this.

Lately I've been noticing some slowness on my machine and I just happened to run **docker ps** and what do I see but:

    docker ps

Yep.  That's the whole set of processes that I was using for my federal friend.  Sigh.  They've been happily sucking up CPU for more than 2 weeks.  **grumble**

The solution:

    docker stop 863768f4f33f dc7f57778b4e df6fd902c11b 0b0eb7730fb0 605da7fe5159
