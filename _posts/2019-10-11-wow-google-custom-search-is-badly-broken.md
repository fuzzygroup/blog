So I just happened to be over on ruby-doc.org and I did a search on for strfitme.  This was the astonishingly bad results:

WHAT. THE. HELL??? The first result on ruby-doc.org for strftime is how to use strftime for python!!!  Now if you look closely here, what you will see is that the python entry is coming up as an **ad**.  Let's look at this again - here is what you see when you are on a 13" MacBook Pro with a Retina display:

So here are the errors from a user interface perspective:

1.  Ads within the search results ARE NOT clearly labeled.  That's bullshite; I'm sorry but it is bullshite.  If the ads look just like actual search results then, well, it is confusing as hell.  I am a search professional and I got confused.
2. There are enough ads that the first search result is off screen entirely -- on a decent size screen -- think about how this looks on Mobile ...

The actual first search result is:

[https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.5.1/libdoc/date/rdoc/DateTime.html](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.5.1/libdoc/date/rdoc/DateTime.html)

and that's ok but the better result is to the offset link:

[https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.5.1/libdoc/date/rdoc/DateTime.html#method-i-strftime](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.5.1/libdoc/date/rdoc/DateTime.html#method-i-strftime)
