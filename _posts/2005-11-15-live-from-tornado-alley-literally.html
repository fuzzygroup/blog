<p>*chuckle*.  Today is increasingly surreal.  Earlier today things were fine, I was grinding on code, made a presentation to our Japanese partners, writing tools to make sure that Feedster search results don't run amok, etc.  Now there's a fierce thunderstorm, lightning, high wind, horizontal rain and the sirens just went off (which in Indiana means "Stop Blogging and Get to the storm shelter if you can hear this").   *going*.</p>
