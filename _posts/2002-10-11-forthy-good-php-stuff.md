<h3>Frothy Good PHP Stuff</h3>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>The PHP Cookbook has been announced by O'Reilly and Chapter 8 on Web Programming is&nbsp;available as a downloadable PDF.&nbsp; I'ved added it to my permanent collection and you should too.&nbsp; There's a very nice trick about "unregistering" users who register but don't confirm their account with you.&nbsp; It's also already in the Amazon listings (it's due out in November).&nbsp; It looks sweet ! (and it's on my wishlist too).&nbsp; I'd definitely but it from Amazon since they have it for a 30% savings.&nbsp; And, if you are a WaldenBooks preferred reader member, I have it on pretty good authority that WaldenBooks preferred reader members will shortly be able to use their discount cards at Amazon.&nbsp; That's cool.</p>

<p dir="ltr">A really good article on working with Files in PHP over on O'Reilly's Lamp site.&nbsp; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013031121/http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/php/2002/10/03/php_foundations.html">[ Go ]</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">From <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013031121/http://www.keithdevens.com/weblog/?id2890">Keith</a> comes a really good pointer to a PHP Builder article on vCalendar / iCalendar programming in PHP.&nbsp; Given that I'm regularly hacking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013031121/http://sourceforge.net/projects/webcalendar/">WebCalendar</a> (and want to add this), that's an awesome find.&nbsp; Thanks Man! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013031121/http://www.phpbuilder.com/columns/chow20021007.php3">[ Go ]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">A pretty good article on PHP error messages.&nbsp; Good stuff to understand.&nbsp; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013031121/http://www.devarticles.com/art/1/211">[ Go ]</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">An interesting class library, Eclipse, for PHP.&nbsp; It seems to be written by a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013031121/http://www.devarticles.com/printpage.php?articleId=218">rather arrogant fellow</a> who doesn't seem to even like the language.&nbsp; So why'd he even bother?&nbsp; Here's a quote: "The real war is between .NET and JSP. PHP will stand on the side, I think. The reason I use PHP is its high availability. Nothing more. "&nbsp; That's fine but he should really go use Perl if that's his criteria.&nbsp; Anyone ever used this puppy?&nbsp; It seems way too object oriented for my taste.&nbsp; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013031121/http://www.students.cs.uu.nl/people/voostind/eclipse/">[ Go ]</a></p></blockquote>
