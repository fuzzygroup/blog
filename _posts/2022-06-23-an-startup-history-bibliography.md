I've been reading High Tech case studies now since the 80s -- just after I entered the business.  [Bryan Cantrill](https://twitter.com/bcantrill) from [Oxide Computer's podcast](https://feeds.transistor.fm/oxide-and-friends) inspired me to get all my books out and order them on a rough historical basis.  I thought listing them here might be interesting to someone.  All of these I've read and there are a ton of lessons for entrepreneurs here.  I put rough notes next to some of them **in bold** after the author name in quotes.
