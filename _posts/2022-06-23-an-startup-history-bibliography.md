I've been reading High Tech case studies now since the 80s -- just after I entered the business.  [Bryan Cantrill](https://twitter.com/bcantrill) from [Oxide Computer's podcast](https://feeds.transistor.fm/oxide-and-friends) inspired me to get all my books out and order them on a rough historical basis.  I thought listing them here might be interesting to someone.  All of these I've read and there are a ton of lessons for entrepreneurs here.  I put rough notes next to some of them **in bold** after the author name in quotes.

<p>This is an absolute gem of a book.  There is a lot of humor here but the best bits, the parts I underline, start on Page 308 where he outlines positioning for a software product.  In an extremely telling bit of analysis, he opens the book by looking at software companies in 1984 and then 2001. Even though there were a number of companies both larger than Microsoft or approximately Microsoft's size, in 2001, the next runner up, Adobe, is 1/20th of Microsoft's size.  This he attributes to Microsoft being the only company "that never made a fatal, stupid mistake".  And, yes, Ashton-Tate is part of the 1984 list.  Yes it is dated but it is also timeless.  <strong>Recommended</strong co>.</p>
