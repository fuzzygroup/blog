_Marketing 101. Consulting 101. PHP Consulting. Random geeky stuff. I Blog Therefore I Am._

<font size="+1"><b>Marketing 101: Selling Services as if they were Products</b></font>

With the number of people that are currently out of work (and it's nowhere near as good as the government wants us to believe), I get email from every day -- and from every country -- about people wanting to consult and not knowing quote how to do it.&nbsp; In this article I'm going to talk about "Selling Services As If They Were Products".&nbsp; This is a marketing technique which lets consulting services be sold more effectively.&nbsp; I've been doing this, with moderate success, since 1992 and I've always been pleased with the results.

### Understand the Customer's Viewpoint: Services Versus Products

The first thing to understand about purchasing something is that it involves **risk**.&nbsp; If it's a software product then the risks are something like these:

- It might not work 
- It would take time 
- It might lose data 

Now with services, the risk is different.&nbsp; The risk is more one that is perceived by the customer than actual.&nbsp; For example, the customer sees a consultant and some of the following questions come to mind, either explicitly or implicitly:

- What can he do for me? 
- What does it cost? 
- What do I take away from it?

Now, whenever a customer has questions, those questions are **disincentives** to purchase -- they make the customer NOT want to purchase.&nbsp; If the customer has too many questions then he or she just won't purchase.&nbsp; And, in my mind, three questions is too many.&nbsp; That's three separate opportunities a customer has to not spend money with you.&nbsp; You just don't want that.

### Productizing a Service

As you can probably guess, my solution is to "productize" a service offering.&nbsp; This means taking whatever service you offer and making a product out of it.&nbsp; This brings up the obvious question -- when everything is so often just bits anyway, what's the difference between services and products?&nbsp; Here's my take on it:

1. Products are clearly defined -- there is a "spec" for a product in the form of product literature.&nbsp; Good product literature goes a long way towards making customers feel better about purchasing a product.&nbsp; And you can do product literature for services too (examples below).   
2. Pricing is clear -- there certainly are products where pricing isn't clear.&nbsp; But, by and large, most products have clear pricing models that can be understood.&nbsp; There is no reason why you can't set a price for a service offering, and not lose money on it --- if your "spec" is clear.&nbsp; This means that your "product literature" for the service has to spell out the terms of your offering.   
3. There's a take away -- this is very important to a customer.&nbsp; Having something tangible, be it code, a report, a signed off set of bugs, an mp3 file (see below, I'm getting to it) makes people feel good and it validates the overall transaction.   
4. Products are easy to purchase -- this is really, really important.&nbsp; Everyone is so busy today that if you don't make the purchasing process just plain drop dead easy for your service then it's not going to happen.&nbsp; 

### Examples

I'm going to illustrate this with a practical, real world example (this&nbsp;service actually exists).&nbsp; I'm not certain if my description of how they got started is or isn't correct but it's plausible.&nbsp; Let's say you were an experienced open source programmer in PHP.&nbsp; There is always a market for technical support.&nbsp; You set up a web site and focus not on big support contracts but on providing support via email, AOL Instant Messenger, Jabber, etc.&nbsp; And you charge $26.95 per month.&nbsp; This web site actually exists, [www.phphelpdesk.com](http://www.phphelpdesk.com/), and they really meet all the criteria:

1. Pretty good web site for product literature.   
2. Clear pricing.   
3. Take away (solved problems / example code).   
4. Easy to purchase (they could really do better here).

They seem to do a really good job.&nbsp; I don't think there is a Python help desk.&nbsp; Anyone out there want to run with this?

### Conclusion

Selling services as products isn't a panacea -- it tends to lower the price and that can be bad.&nbsp; The real benefit though is that not only does it make it easier for customers to purchase from you, it also gets people used to purchasing from you.&nbsp; One thing that you can generally count on is that once people purchase from you once, if you do a good job, they are much more likely to purchase again.&nbsp; The reason for this is that having let them "sample from the menu with an appetizer" they are better prepared to hire you for bigger projects i.e. "the full meal".

### Postscript: Putting My Money Where My Mouth Is

If there's anything in this world that's just plain annoying,&nbsp;it's when consultants pontificate about things but never, ever follow through.&nbsp; That's just wrong.&nbsp; So here's my new "service as product":

**Marketing 101: The One Hour Crash Consult**.&nbsp;

**Product Literature:**

See [http://www.fuzzygroup.com/services/marketing101/onehour/](http://www.fuzzygroup.com/services/marketing101/onehour/)

**Quick Description:**

Looking for marketing help for your high tech product or service?&nbsp; Email me or IM me and we'll set up a scheduled 1 hour voice call&nbsp;to discuss your situation.&nbsp; Let me know your website url in advance and I'll make sure that I'm up to speed so you don't have to educate me.&nbsp; Not in the U.S.?&nbsp; If you have a high speed connection then we can use Yahoo Messenger.&nbsp; I did a two hour call last week to Hong Kong and it worked pretty much flawlessly.&nbsp; And it's free.

**Price:**

Normally $100 U.S. but $60 U.S. for bloggers if you mention this article.&nbsp; Offer valid through September, 2002.&nbsp; Sign up for six sessions for $300 (that's one session for free!).

**Pay By:**

Amazon Tip Jar or PayPal.

**What do I Take Away?**

I'll record the whole session as an MP3 file and let you download it afterwards.&nbsp; You can then give this MP3 file to your inhouse marketing staff rather than worrying about taking notes, etc.&nbsp; This is a great way to informally capture knowledge.

**Question You're Thinking But Don't Want to Ask:**

Does this mean that you won't answer emails any longer?&nbsp; Nope.&nbsp; I know quite well that this isn't for everyone but I suspect that it will be useful for some.&nbsp; The benefits of a real time interaction, particularly one that you can play back after the fact, are huge.
