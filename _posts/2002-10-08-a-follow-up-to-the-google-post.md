<p>Oh and just to clarify even my Google rankings changed.&nbsp; Searching for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013031121/http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;safe=off&amp;q=Scott+Johnson">Scott Johnson</a> now gives me only the 3 top pages on the Internet.&nbsp; So while I still have the top place I now have fewer of the top places and I don't think that's bad.</p>
