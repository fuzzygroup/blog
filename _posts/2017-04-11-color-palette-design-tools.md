Well Google released their new color palette tool for [Material](https://material.io/color/) and I thought I should point out some of the other tools for this: 

* [Sankk.in](https://www.sankk.in/material-mixer/)
* [Flat UI Colors](http://flatuicolors.com/)
* [MaterialPalette](https://www.materialpalette.com/)
* [Adobe Color Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/)
* [Material Design Bootstrap](https://mdbootstrap.com/css/colors/)
* [Color-Hex](http://www.color-hex.com/color-palettes/)

Thanks to this [Hacker News thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14085425) for surfacing some of these; the last two I found when I went looking for bootstrap versions.
