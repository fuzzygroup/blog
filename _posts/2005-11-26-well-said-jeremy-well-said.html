<p><a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/">Jeremy</a>, an engineer on Yahoo Search, in discussing why people find Google's results to be the best, even in the face of a blind "taste test" which proves they <strong>aren't</strong> shows tremendous courage with this post which quotes Seth Godin's post on the same topic:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jeremy: I won't go into the flaws with this method, since that's really not the point.  He goes on to say:</p>
<p>Seth: Which reinforces my point that Google isn't "better" for most people if "better" means more relevant or deeper. Google is better because it <strong>feels</strong> better and quicker and leaner and easier to use. The story we tell ourselves about Google is very different, and we use it differently as a result. Think about that the next time you insist you need a "better" formula or a faster server or a stronger first baseman.</p>
<p>Seth: Music sounds better through an iPod because we think it does. Design matters. Stories matter most of all.</p>

<p>Jeremy: Bingo!</p>

<p>Given that I just finished Seth's book "<a href="http://www.allmarketersareliars.com/">All Marketers are Liar</a>s" and, honestly, loved it, this resonates tremendously with me. Now given that we're thinking lots and lots about Feedster's design issues right now, I need to point out this information to our people.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
