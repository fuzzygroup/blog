I've now personally seen the impact of COVID-19 -- a good friend -- who was in my house less than 10 days ago has been diagnosed with the following:

* May have COVID-19 but a test wasn't available
* Need to self quarantine for 2 weeks following the onset of symptoms

This raises the question:

> How do you help a person in quarantine?

Here are some thoughts:

1. You don't want to be in that person's physical presence.  It is QUARANTINE.
2. But all of us are a community.  You can't NOT help people; that isn't an option.
3. You can online order things for them.
4. You deliver to their front porch or front door the things that they need.  **And then you leave**.
5. You call them to tell them that what they need is waiting for them.

## What Does a Quarantined Person Need?

Here's what I would recommend:

* Liquids that they like to drink; for this person it was tea and honey
* Gatorade or another sports drink for dehydration
* Easy to prepare food
* Cold / Cough medicine
* Help getting their prescriptions picked up
* Painkillers but not [Ibuoprofen](https://www.sciencealert.com/who-recommends-to-avoid-taking-ibuprofen-for-covid-19-symptoms)
* Humidifier
* Soap
* Crackers or something to help with nausea

## Other Thoughts

I'd like to tell you that all of this can be done online (and, yes, CVS will do online ordering and delivery) but I don't think that's necessarily correct given the size of this crisis.  I think we are going to need to do a lot of physical visits to help our friends and neighbors.
