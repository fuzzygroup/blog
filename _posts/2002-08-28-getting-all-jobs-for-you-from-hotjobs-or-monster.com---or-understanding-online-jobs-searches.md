**Getting All Jobs for You From HotJobs or Monster.com - or Understanding Online Jobs Searches**

I don't know about many of you out there, maybe I am just different, but whenever I use [Monster](http://www.monster.com/) or another job service, I then have a friend send me an even better job the next day.&nbsp; Its gotten so bad that I was thinking that 10+ years building search engines hadn't taught me anything.&nbsp; Then I looked a little more closely and this is what the problem turned out to be.

I am a 34 year old white male who has worked in high tech his entire career, predominantly in a leadership product management or engineering management role.&nbsp; This is the job that I want to get again (fate willing).&nbsp;

**NOTE:** I'm no longer in the job market, having (again) started my own business, but I left the above text in to set the context.

So, taking these criteria, I made up the following Monster Query:

&nbsp;[Click](http://jobsearch.monster.com/jobsearch.asp?cy=US&brd=1&lid=453&lid=893&lid=892&lid=455&lid=454&lid=705&lid=530&fn=6&fn=554&q=")&nbsp;

What this first query does is give me all jobs either Software or Internet in MA or NH.&nbsp; Technically this query returns too much information since I don't qualify it by adding "product manager".&nbsp; We'll come to this in a second.

What I found when I was using this query exclusively is that I wasn't getting certain jobs at all!&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because even though some of those companies were in the software or internet business, Monster **doesn't know** them as such.&nbsp; A clear categorization failure.&nbsp; **Sigh**.&nbsp; **Grumble**.&nbsp; Enter approach #2.

In approach #2, we drop out the industry criteria completely and then rely on "Product Manager" (with quotes).&nbsp; This is shown below:

&nbsp;[Click](http://jobsearch.monster.com/jobsearch.asp?cy=US&brd=1&lid=453&lid=893&lid=892&lid=455&lid=454&lid=705&lid=530&fn=6&fn=554&q=%22Product+Manager%22)

Now for the jobs that I am also looking for include "Product Marketing Manager" (since I can legitimately do this and have had this title before).&nbsp; This means that we'll need an approach #3 to handle that different job title.

&nbsp;[Click](http://jobsearch.monster.com/jobsearch.asp?cy=US&brd=1&lid=453&lid=893&lid=892&lid=455&lid=454&lid=705&lid=530&q=%22Product+Marketing+Manager%22)

Now the final problem is how to make these three links so drop dead easy to use that I will actually bother to check them every single day -- usually multiple times.&nbsp; What to do?&nbsp; The best approach I found was to get Monster to do the query and then drag the URL of the query onto the link toolbar.&nbsp;This is how I started and is shown below (the link is red for clarity):

![](http://www.fuzzygroup.net/writing/images/gettin16.jpg)

The problem with this is what if you have a LOT OF queries.&nbsp; After all, there isn't just [Monster](http://www.monster.com/), there is [FlipDog](http://www.flipdog.com/) and [HotJobs](http://www.hotjobs.com/) among others.&nbsp; This moved me to a Favorites based approach as shown below:

I'm not done figuring out how to make the job search easier but this has helped.
