Your Rails 6 master key is located in:

    config/credentials/production.key

and it is likely stored as a hidden file.  I believe that this is generated when the project is generated but I'm not 100% certain.

See this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/ci45t2/rails_6_masterkey/).
