**Note**: This is a work in progress.  Rather than finish it in one go, I'm updating it live as a draft document as I learn new things about Twitter.  Last update: **2022-06-15**

I am, at heart, a long form blogger.  Still -- the cool kids, as they say -- these days are all on twitter (and, yes, I know by saying it that way, I'm dating myself even further; so be it; it amuses me).

I find myself, here in 2022, wanting to get a better handle on Twitter.  This will be a regularly updated blog post summarizing what I've learned.

## Rule 0: You Are Screaming Into the Void

The first thing to understand is that Twitter as a whole is enormous and no one is going to notice, or even care, that you are there.  There is very much an aspect of screaming into the void.  

## Rule 1: You Are Going to Have to Work to Get Noticed

When a social media is new then can be easy to get established.  When a social media already exists though, it is a lot of work to establish yourself.  You need to throw away any expectations that you are going to be successful on Twitter quickly and get ready for a long grind of creating content.

## Rule 2: Hash Tags

A hash tag is an identifier that describes your content.  What I have noticed is that without hash tags, my content may as well not exist.  Add hash tags to your tweet just by adding a hash mark or **#** to the end of your tweets.

## Rule 3: @ sign Someone if It is Relevant

## Rule 4: Direct Messaging People on Twitter is Quite Real

## Rule 5: Check Your Mentions


## Rule 6: Keep At It

## Rule 7: Decide On Your One Metric

Twitter has a number of metrics:

* Followers
* Retweets
* Likes
* Mentions

Trying to pay attention to all of these at once is, for someone who isn't metric oriented and isn't a marketer, a kind of sucky experience.  My choice was that I was going to use my Followers count as the metric.  When I started this experiment, I had 207 followers.  Now I have 209 followers.  Progress???

## Rule 8: Experiment and Learn from It

## Rule 9: Don't Just Tweet Your Own Stuff

Imagine Twitter as if it was a party.  If you are only posting your own stuff, it is analogous to that dude bro at a party who only talks about himself.  Figure out the intersection between your own content (for me that's ruby / rails / cloud) and stuff that other people talk about.  And then when you find something that's in that intersection, that is what you should tweet / retweet / like.

## Rule 10: This is Link Blogging All Over Again

## Rule 11: Flow and Tone Matter
