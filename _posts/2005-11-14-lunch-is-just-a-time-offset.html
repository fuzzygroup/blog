<p>Lunch, for me, has long been nothing but a time offset. Think about it -- if you wake at 7 and eat lunch at noon that's a 5 hour offset.  Right ?  So if you think of lunch as a time delta from the period you wake then its completely appropriate to have Spicy Hot Shrimp Gumbo at 6:17 am.  Of course you have start working at roughly 1:43 am to pull this off.</p>
<p>And, if you think that this is nothing but a way for me to rationalize to my wife that I should get away with eating shrimp gumbo at 6:17 am then you get the bonus prize.  Thank you for playing.  Please come again. </p>
