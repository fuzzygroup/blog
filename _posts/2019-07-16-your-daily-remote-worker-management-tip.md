Dear Manager of a Remote Employee, 

My apologies in advance that this is bitter and salty like the code brewed coffee that I just swilled in a frazzle but I find myself at the end of my rope. And so I will give you a remote worker management tip.  

When a remote worker, particularly when it is an individual who has worked for you for more than a year, says "we need to work on XYZ in person", it basically amounts to "Oh my lord, we are so damn screwed".  AND YOU PAY ATTENTION TO IT AND ARRANGE IT.

Sigh.

Signed, 
Your Remote Worker
