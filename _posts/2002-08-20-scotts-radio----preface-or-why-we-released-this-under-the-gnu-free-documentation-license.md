### Moving to the GNU Free Documentation License for My PHP Writing

I wrote most of this material several months ago.&nbsp; Since that time I've continued to blog, been the author of the Radio chapters in the [O'Reilly blogging book "Essential Blogging"](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/essblogging/), written tons of code, gotten new clients and done just many different things.&nbsp; I also see these pages continue to get hits week after week, day after day.&nbsp; It occurred to me that my release of them was so long ago (well in web years) that they could benefit from "packaging" them into a whole -- as a book.&nbsp;

As I noted in [Why I'm Releasing the FuzzyOffice Documentation under the GNU Free Documentation License](http://radio.weblogs.com/0103807/2002/08/15.html#a450), I'm the author of two (well 1 full book and partial author of 1 is more accurate) commercially published computer books published in the past&nbsp;6 years and I have to say that I am suffering with&nbsp;[rage](http://radio.weblogs.com/0103807/2002/08/14.html#a444) about the process.&nbsp; I don't want to bother people with a brutal rant.&nbsp; I will comment that during the writing of my most recent computer book, I was so frustrated that I took the time to find a professional literary agent and consult with him.&nbsp; After discussing the situation with him, he made a very interesting comment that has been zinging around my brain ever since:

> _"If you can write ANY other type of book besides a computer book then you should do so."_

His point was very simple -- computer books are easy to get published but the compensation basically sucks, the publisher has all the control and it's pretty much a rigged game.&nbsp; And, on this, I'd have to agree with him.&nbsp; I'd also add that publishers are pretty much incompetent in general.&nbsp; Even technical publishers seem to suffer from this.

So, if I have a case of rage against the system then I clearly don't want to publish these as a conventional dead tree book.&nbsp; It just wouldn't make sense.&nbsp; And, to be very honest, I'd rather flip burgers or utter once of these two phrases on a regular basis:

- Would you like fries with that? 
- Would you like foam with that latte?

I'm taking a lead here from [Mark Pilgrim's](http://www.diveintomark.org/) use of the [GNU Free Documentation License](http://radio.weblogs.com/0103807/stories/2002/08/14/phplargeFuzzyofficeAppendix1TermsOfUse.html) that provides a legal framework for freely releasing written works.&nbsp; Thanks Mark!
