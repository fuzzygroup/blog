I had a really, really interesting talk with a friend yesterday about the current times and they commented to me:

> My mom has come to live with me and she is immuno-compromised (COPD) so we're taking this really, really seriously.

Even though perhaps we should all just hunker down, adopt a bunker mentality and never let anyone into our homes, that's just **not realistic** or **even viable**.  What we need to do is be *smart* about this.  They spoke to me a bit about their precautions and I've merged them with the things we are doing and here you go!

## You Are Going to Have Visitors So Be Safe!

1. Put a hand washing reminder sign on your door.
2. Put wipes by the door so that no one has to touch your door handle.  If you can't get wipes then maybe a sack of old grocery bags.
3. Put a trash can by the inside of the door so you can throw away the wipe or grocery bag.
4. Shoes come off inside the door and are left on a mat
5. Remove the hand towels from all your bathrooms and substitute paper towels (bad hand washing can leave the virus on a cloth towel for the next person).
