<font size="+1"><b>Online Relationships: Brains Are All Around You</b></font>

I just ran into a situation that really pointed out to me just how true the statement from Bill Joy of [Sun Microsystems](http://www.sun.com/)&nbsp;is: "_There are more brains outside your organization walls than inside_".&nbsp; And I thought it was an interesting commentary on how an initial nebulous, ephermal IM relationship grows over time and then just saves you when you need it most.

## Overview

I got back into PHP in a fairly big way in the end of March 2002.&nbsp; I signed up for the php-general mailing list and was the initiator of an effort to make a better FAQ.&nbsp; As these things happen, I wrote the FAQ application but it never really got deployed.&nbsp; A new client came in, that code got a bit sidelined and so on.&nbsp; I just never got back to i.

However, along the way, I started exchanging instant messages (IMs) with someone named Demitrious Kelly.&nbsp; Now, at the time, I had no idea who he was, age, male or female, geography, etc.&nbsp; I just had the gut feel from about the 3rd IM that he was just **smart** and **practical**.&nbsp; This is a combination that I am very, very fond of -- brains without practicality brings systems down.&nbsp; And practicality without brains doesn't let you get things done quickly.&nbsp; I've probably hired between between 70 and 100 technical people in my career so I'd at least like to think that I know talent when it walks up and taps me on the back.&nbsp; (Disclaimer: I've only had to fire maybe 3 to 5 people out of that, at least two of whom were rescue transfers from other departments, so that's a pretty good batting average).

## As the IMs Went On

This has continued now for about 3 months.&nbsp; We kept IMing at random times.&nbsp; We'd swap php stuff, I'd point him to my blog and so on.&nbsp; He'd point me to his web site, [http://www.apokalyptik.com](http://www.apokalyptik.com), when he had something cool and so on.&nbsp; I learned that he had a background doing SysAdmin work for an ISP that sold out.&nbsp; We debated different Unices and Linices and he turned me on to the very cool [GenToo Linux](http://www.gentoo.org/).&nbsp; He also gave me some outstanding advice on a difficult situation that I mulled over for a few days and then followed -- and it was 100% the right advice.

## And then Today I Needed Help

Over the weekend and mostly today I brought up a new box at RackSpace to replace an incompetent, inept,&nbsp; brain damaged, pathetic excuse for an ISP (no ... I don't feel strongly here).&nbsp; And when I needed some quick Linux and Apache help today, he was online and " **Poof**" -- like magic I had my answer in about 2 minutes (it might actually have been 1).&nbsp; Could I have figured it out on my own?&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; It might have taken 10 minutes or an hour but I could have done it.&nbsp; Thankfully I didn't have to.&nbsp; Saving time like this is critical for a startup, heck, for any company.

## Conclusion and a Plug for a Good Guy Who's Now Freelancing

So I really do have to agree even more with Bill Joy -- the brains aren't within your own walls.&nbsp; They are discrete nodes located all over the globe.&nbsp; And, if you need them, they'll help you.&nbsp; This is tremendously cool since all of our organizations are both concurrently larger than ever (HP and Compaq) and smaller than ever (well, me and my partner).&nbsp; And all of our organizations can always make use of fantastic specialized talent at different times.&nbsp; What I know about search engines, Demitrious knows in his areas.

I also just recently found out that Demitrious is freelancing and doing PHP scripting, Bash scripting and generalized SysAdmin work for hire.&nbsp; As far as I am concerned, he's worth it -- and I also wouldn't have any qualms about giving him access to my boxes for what it's worth.&nbsp; He knows what he's doing and he's been great to me.&nbsp;

So I am definitely biased here but he's still worth a plug.&nbsp; Highly Recommended.
