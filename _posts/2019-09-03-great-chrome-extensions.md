A buddy just turned me onto [Tab Switcher](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-switcher/gcilookdakgpccpbcjgnpaecofklimck?hl=en), a tool that gives the ability to SEARCH THE TITLES OF YOUR TABS !!!!  How the hell doesn't this exist in Chrome already?  

Just install it and then press: 

* OSX: Control + Shift + K
* Windows: Control + Shift + K

And you will get a window like this:

And beyond Tab Switcher, [The Great Suspender](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-suspender/klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg) is absolutely fantastic.  The Great Suspender turns off open tabs that are taking up too much memory -- it is like putting Chrome on a damn diet and it is wonderful.
