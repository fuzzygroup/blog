Just as an example of how fast things can happen in the AWS world, I skyped over to a colleague "I think we need another crawling box" at 3:48 am this morning.  Then I took care of it and got that box up and running.  My response back to him was at 4:09 am.  So 12 + 9 or 21 minutes total to go from a 5 node installation to a 6 node installation.  Coming from the world of traditional hosting where the flow is more like:

* email hosting company
* explain what is needed
* go back and forth a few times
* wait a day or two
* run chef on the box to configure everything and have it half broken at the end because, well, chef
* fix it manually
* get code deployed
* deal with randomness
* get it running

My usual turn around time on getting a new box is close to a week when all is said and done so 21 minutes feels like, well, **magic**.  And, honestly, I could have done it faster.  I muddled about a bit, checked mail, read a tweet or two, etc.  Now if I had properly scripted everything, this could have been probably less than 5 minutes end to end.  I'm not yet at that point in my AWS journey (still using the AWS web tools step by step).
