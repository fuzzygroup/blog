<p>Any developer has, at one point in his or her career, had this type of conversation between themselves and one or more other developers:</p>
<p>(04:31:39) <strong>mikeair888:</strong> and we've still got a full day US time<br />
(04:32:01) <strong>fuzzygroup:</strong> more than that actually<br />
(04:32:13) <strong>fuzzygroup:</strong> the board meeting is at 9 am pst which is 12 pm est<br />
(04:32:26) <strong>mikeair888:</strong> oh cool<br />
(04:32:29) <strong>fuzzygroup:</strong> and its 5 am here (ok 4:30 but lets make the math easy)<br />
(04:32:33) <strong>mikeair888:</strong> yep<br />
(04:32:35) <strong>fuzzygroup:</strong> so that's 24 + 7 hours<br />
(04:32:39) <strong>fuzzygroup:</strong> or 31 hours total</p>
