<p>Someone recently IM'd me about my "<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0103807/2002/09/02.html">100 Things About Me</a>" post which was, good lord, 3 plus years old and I thought this was an interesting meme: <strong>10 things which have changed about you or are just plain geeky as all heck since you either started a web 2.0 company or joined one</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>New favorite caffeinated beverage: <strong>Vietnamese iced coffee</strong></li>
<li>Number of post mortem documents you have written with at least one #$&amp;#*($# word in them: <strong>ALL</strong>.</li>
<li>Number of times you've installed linux on company servers: <strong>At least 40</strong>.</li>
<li>Number of tattoos you had when you started company / joined company: <strong>0</strong>.<br />
Number you have now: <strong>1</strong>.<br />
Number visible with clothes on: <strong>0</strong>.</li>
<li>Number of times you've slept in the office: <strong>Don't know but its likely within the size of a MySQL tinyint field</strong>.</li>
<li>Number of people you've dated since your web 2.0 experience started: <strong>1</strong>.</li>
<li>Geekiest thing you've done since you joined a web 2.0 company: <strong>Convert an Intel 486sx chip to a keychain while watching my son take a bath</strong>.</li>
<li>Number of times you've changed blogging tools: <strong>5</strong>.</li>
<li>Number of times you've sworn at a blogging tool when you lost a post with it: Well it certainly exceeds the maximum value of #5.</li>
<li>Number of venture capitalists who've turned you down: <strong>Next question please</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>And, for the special bonus round:</p>
<ol>
<li>Number of pounds you've put on since you started: <strong>12</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: You're 10 things would be likely different than mine.  That's good.  I'm just curious if my experiences are the norm.  <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/">Niall</a>?  Want to continue this?</p>
