<p>As I've commented on my <a href="http://scott.feedster.com/">Feedster Blog</a>, which is alas, down right now, <a href="http://feedster.com/">Feedster</a> just added <a href="http://podcast.feedster.com/">Podcast Search</a>. Here are some thoughts on that: </p>
<ol>
<li>Tap into the public OPML directories.</li>
<li>Expect the public OML directories to all be in slightly different flavors of OPML.</li>
<li>Regularly revise and test your regex's if you use a regex based OPML parser. We've never been comfortable with any of the public OPML parsing libraries so we rolled a regex parser and use it regularly while often griping about it. ;-)   </li>
<li>Don't expect sites like <a href="http://www.odeo.com/">Odeo</a> to support a public, parseable directory.  Understanding their URL syntax tho will go a long way.</li>
<li>Expect that lots of things won't appear in any directory. I just finished writing a "Deep Discovery" tool that utilizes our database of 17 million plus feed urls and scans it for podcasts. Right now its added another 500 podcasts (which doesn't sound like a lot but when your base is 38,000 or so, its actually statistically significant) (oh and its still running). (Up to 640 more feeds since I started this post)   </li>
<li>Realize that there are lots of non-US podcasting sites.  We've even found podcasting in <a href="http://russianpodcasting.ru/podcast/bezda4e/rss.xml">russian</a>.     </li>
<li>Realize that people may consider themselves podcasters but never have encountered an enclosure tag in their lives. I don't want to name names but this was very, very surprising to me.    </li>
<li>Subscription and Metadata standards are confused.  Things like the iTunes metadata extensions (<a href="http://www.alessandrorisuleo.com/podcasts/video">example feed using them</a>) versus the <a href="http://podcast411.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=98">iTunes pcast files and the pcast:// psuedo urls</a>.   </li>
</ol>
<p>Right now implementing podcast search is a lot like implementing blog search was when we started Feedster -- confused and emergent. You'll have to do a rat load of work you don't want to and don't feel should be necessary. But, in the end*, it'll be worth it.  </p>
