<p>My oh my.  I'm just plain astonished at the rich, frothy goodness that is <a href="http://desktop.google.com/?promo=mp-gds-v1-1">Google Sidebar / Google Desktop 2.0</a> / whatever the heck they call it.  This thing is bloody well rocking my world.  Yes I know that I'm the last person on the planet to try this new thing from Google which came out more than 6 months ago.  And I agree, like <a href="http://inluminent.com/2005/11/16/google-shows-no-love-for-mac-users/">Inluminent</a> says so well, that there need to be Mac versions of Google stuff.  That said, given that I'm a professional search guy, I've seen this type of thing before.  Verity did it.  Fulcrum did it.  DTSearch did it.  Others have done it.  None of them seem to have done the overall issues of local search as well (note -- I haven't looked at Yahoo's stuff or MSN's stuff yet; when I have time).  Google really nailed this one well.</p>
<p>So here's my committment.  I'm notorious for NOT using new technology.  I still copy files with a DOS shell.  I use notepad even tho I've gotten 25 other tools, etc.  I'm going to give Google Desktop 30 days and not turn it off, not minimize it and see how it shakes out.  If I have to give it screen real estate for 30 days then I'll definitely use it.<br />
The clock starts ... now!</p>
