Given the number of people who are avoid gluten these days, I thought I'd write up a few basic tips and pointers to some of my favorite gluten free recipes.

## General Gluten Free Banking Tips From Years of Experience

1. Use a 1:1 flour replacement.  My current favorite is [Krusteaz](https://www.amazon.com/Krusteaz-Gluten-Purpose-Flour-32-Ounce/dp/B013KRV2LU/).
2. If you are baking gluten free, don't taste the batter!  A lot of gluten free flours are based on bean flours and bean flour, before it is baked, takes like crap.  
3. Anything you bake with a gluten free flour is structurally weaker than with gluten because gluten is a strong, elastic protein.
4. If you want to make bread then just buy the book [Gluten Free Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day](https://www.amazon.com/Gluten-Free-Artisan-Bread-Five-Minutes/dp/1250018315/).  Boules you bake from the basic recipe, page 63, are fantastic.  They are smaller than normal boules (lack of strength) but they taste and feel like real bread.  As a former daily bread baker, these book was like a revelation from on high.
5. A 1:1 flour can generally be substituted in place of wheat flour without other changes except for issues of strength / size (make things smaller).
6. Krusteaz has a great [gluten free pancake mix](https://www.amazon.com/Krusteaz-Gluten-Buttermilk-Pancake-16-Ounce/dp/B00K73KL9U/r).  It is just easier than making it yourself.
