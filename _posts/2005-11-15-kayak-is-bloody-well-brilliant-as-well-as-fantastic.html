<p>I believe that <a href="http://www.kayak.com/">Robert</a> had a link to <a href="http://www.kayak.com/">Kayak</a>, a travel meta search site, recently and I gave it a shot.  Not only has it already saved me literally several hundred dollars in just a few trips but its also made the difference between my family and I having a rental car for our Thanksgiving excursion to Dallas.</p>
<p>Thank you Robert. This ends my use of <a href="http://travel.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Travel</a> I guess.  Wonder if they'll notice.  Wonder if they'll care ? </p>
