<p>Here's one of those success stories you love to hear.&nbsp; A little Canadian company decides to sell prescription drugs over the Internet significantly cheaper than Americans are used to paying.&nbsp; 2 years later they have 170 employees.&nbsp; Here's an example of the savings: 2 months of Novaldex for $220 in the U.S. costs just $42.78 (that's a different pharmacy than RxNorth but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013031121/http://www.rxnorth.com/our_products/search.php?action=search&amp;alpha=n&amp;keyword=&amp;page=3">their savings</a> are very similar; I just didn't have the right example to use RxNorth).&nbsp; Given the obvious issues with health care and insurance in the states anything that makes things cheaper is a rich and forthy goodness.&nbsp; Kudos to RxNorth, well done!</p>
