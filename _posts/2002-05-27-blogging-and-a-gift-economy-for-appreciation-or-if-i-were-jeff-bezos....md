<font size="+1"><b>Blogging and a Gift Economy for Appreciation or If I were Jeff Bezos...</b></font>

Disclaimer 0: I am in no way claiming that this is original, innovative or anything else.&nbsp; It's just the first time that I have run into it.

I ran into an interesting thing in an article on Salon.&nbsp; The Salon article was talking about how teenage girls with webcams were soliciting online gifts using Amazon wish lists.&nbsp; While this was fairly disturbing (do you want your daughter / sister / cousin / niece / whatever) tantalizing anonymous men for Amazon stuff, it made me think about applying the same concept to blogs.&nbsp; Think about it.&nbsp; People are making great content on blogs every single day, sometimes every single hour.&nbsp; As the net gets more and more commercial and more and more advertising driven, I just don't read Salon or MSN or whatever.&nbsp; I read blogs instead.&nbsp; So the question becomes -- how do we keep people making great blogs -- that aren't affected by advertising?&nbsp; My solution: Add an Amazon&nbsp;wishlist to your blog.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is my Amazon wishlist:

[My Wish List](http://www.amazon.com/o/registry/27K5JCB27FUQ6)

If I was Jeff Bezos at Amazon, not only would I promote this actively to the Blog community but I would also implement a "Partial Wish" feature so that different people could pitch in on a gift.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Well, when programming books cost $40, that's a big gift.&nbsp; I'd like to see it as low as $2 or $3.&nbsp; I'd do that in a second for a whole lot of blogs.&nbsp; And then the wish list owner could say "$20 more to go for this.&nbsp; I guess I'll just buy the rest".&nbsp; With email notification as well this becomes highly, highly viral.&nbsp; A lot of times I just don't think to go to Amazon.

You may be thinking "Amazon Tip Jar".&nbsp; My gut feeling is that gifts are different from cash.&nbsp; And gifts give you the opportunity to direct the blog content in ways you might like to see it go.&nbsp; For example, I am a fairly hardcore PHP geek.&nbsp; If someone gifted (that a real world) me with a PHP / MySQL Database book then I would know that he or she might want me to write about this.&nbsp; And I'd probably reward them with articles&nbsp;on that topic.

**Disclaimer 1** : This is not, in any fashion, a solicitation.&nbsp; My "payment" for blogging is the wonderful interaction that I get from readers all over the world (Mike in Australia, Roger in England, Veer in India, Brent in Canada, etc).&nbsp; I just thought that other bloggers like Jeremiah might like this idea and I wanted to make it available.

**Disclaimer 2** : Am I the only person out there who thinks that Amazon's new UI (well, new to me at least) is just not right?&nbsp; Way too busy for my taste.&nbsp;
