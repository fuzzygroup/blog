One of the very, very, very hard things about using email as a marketing tool is that the first impression (and you know I'm big on first impressions) people get can be wildly different.&nbsp; Here are the three basic 1st impressions that you get from an email:

- Subject Line 
- Subject Line with Short Preview 
- Subject Line Above and Preview Pane Below

Now, like many people these days, I have my preview pane turned off to minimize the amount of spam I receive.&nbsp; What's that?&nbsp; You didn't know that the preview pane led to spam?&nbsp; Here's a Public Service Announcement:

**Why You Need to Turn Off Your Preview Pane NOW!!!**

You may not be aware of this but every time a SPAM email is received by you, any viewed at all -- even in the preview pane, it is generally recorded that the person got the email and viewed it.&nbsp; How you ask?&nbsp;

Simple.&nbsp; Many spams include a web "tracking bug" or small 1x1 pixel .GIF file which tells the ad sender that you actually received it and confirms for them that your email address is valid.&nbsp;

[More](http://www.infinisource.com/features/web-bugs.html).

To turn it off in Outlook, use **View** =\> **Preview Pane** and then turn on Auto Preview instead (different but still useful) with **View** =\> **Auto Preview**.

Anyway, back to our topic at hand.&nbsp; When an email is sent, it can be experienced in multiple ways -- and there is NO WAY to predict which way the recipient will use.&nbsp;&nbsp; Take a look at the email below:

### ![](http://radio.weblogs.com/0103807/images/groove_looks_like_a_spammer.gif)

When I look at that, the all UPPERCASE text just grabs me -- and my brain screams SPAM!!!! SPAM!!! RUN!!!&nbsp; DELETE!!!! KILL!!! (I think you get the picture).&nbsp; Then I look a bit furthern and I see "Groove".&nbsp; But, a lot of times, I will have already hit the delete key by that point.&nbsp; Now if you actually open it, you'll see that they aren't spammers:

![](http://radio.weblogs.com/0103807/images/groove_looks_like_a_spammer_not.gif)

What is clearly going on is that Groove has both an HTML and ASCII version of their newsletter.&nbsp; Like&nbsp;a lot of people, at least technical people, I don't like HTML mail (fat, slow) so I opted in for the ASCII version.&nbsp; And a, perhaps clue free, perhaps not, person prepared the ASCII version not thinking about how it might look to a recipient.&nbsp;

**Bottom Line:** Preview outbound emails with at least two or three mail client settings if not different mail clients.&nbsp; Guess what?&nbsp; It's just like testing your web pages on multiple browsers.&nbsp; With the difference that if you screw it up, it is much, much worse since you've pushed it out to potentially many thousands of people -- with no chance to get feedback incrementally.
