A really good search technique which many people often ignore is "Over Searching".&nbsp; When you over search, you take a query and expand it to be not just what the user asked for but what the user is likely to want.&nbsp; Here's a step by step example.

I went to the Saturn web site and selected the Find a Retailer link:

![](http://radio.weblogs.com/0103807/images/scotts_searching_over_searching_saturn_homepage.gif)

Suggestion: Write your web site text the way that real people use words.&nbsp; Have you ever heard of a Car Retailer?&nbsp; Probably not -- it's a Car Dealer.

This took me to a search screen:

I filled in "Medford" and chose Massachusetts as the state.&nbsp; Now I know for a fact that there is a Saturn dealer in Medford, Massachusetts so I was expecting to get only this one result.&nbsp; So I was quite pleasantly surprised when I got this instead:

That's right -- three results.&nbsp; These are (I think though I'm not sure) the closest dealers to Medford.&nbsp; Now I was wondering if there were only three Saturn dealers in Massachusetts so&nbsp; I just searched for Massachusetts and got this:

There are clearly a lot more than three Saturn dealers in Massachusetts.&nbsp;

This was a nice implementation of Over Searching.&nbsp; What they did was correctly recognize that a person, even if they are highly specific in their search query, might benefit from knowing about more than just that one search result.&nbsp; If you think about it, it makes sense:

- They could have&nbsp;a bad experience with a dealer and want another option
- It tells them where they can get service even if their original dealer is busy
- It gives the customer a "warm and fuzzy" feeling that there is more than one dealership if they need it
- It provides them with another option

Nicely done!&nbsp; Kudos to Saturn for this one.
