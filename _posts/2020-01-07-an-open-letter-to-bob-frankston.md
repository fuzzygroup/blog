Hi [Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Frankston), 

I strongly doubt you remember but I met you years ago as part of the Boston Blogging group that [Dave Winer](http://www.scripting.com/) used to organize.  About the same time I also met [Dan Bricklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Bricklin).

I wanted to make a suggestion to you.  I've been subscribed to you in my aggregator for a long time but due to the design of aggregators, it isn't clear if a post in the aggregator is full content or summary.  Here's all I saw of your current (wonderful) [CES post](http://rmf.vc/IEEECE202001):

> CES is a time to see new products and services. Alas, my expectations might be too high.

I thought this was just a lament but I happened to click through and lo and below, a **wonderful** bit of writing. 

So my suggestion to you is to change your blogging tool to output the *full content* of each post you write.  

My suspicion is that for **yourself** it is more important that you get your ideas out into the universe than that you drive people to **your** site.  This is the single best reason for a full content feed.  Every time you have to rely on someone clicking thru from their aggregator to your site, there is a solid chance (1 in 2; 1 in 3; 1 in 5; 1 in 10 ???) that they just won't).  Often times they don't ever know that there is more content out there; I certainly didn't and I've been in the RSS world now for almost 20 years and I have pretty solid credentials in the RSS world -- I was the creator of the Feedster RSS and Blog search engine.

**Note**: My own [blog](https://fuzzyblog.io/blog/) and my [recipes](https://fuzzyblog.io/recipes/) are all done with full content feeds so I'm not askign you to do anything that I'm not doing.  Also full content feeds aren't really any harder than a summary feed - just put out the full content.  Feel free to use [my feed](https://fuzzyblog.io/blog/feed.xml) as an example.  Even better -- use [Dave's](http://scripting.com/rss.xml).

Btw I loved this point: "I mount the devices as soft infrastructure using 3M Command Strips which means I can take it off the wall and use it as a flashlight.".  Damn brilliant and I've started doing this with devices.  Thank you.

And thank you for all the wonderful work you've done over the years. I started with VisiCalc way, way back in the 80s.
