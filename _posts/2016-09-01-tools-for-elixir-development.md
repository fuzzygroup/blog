One of the first things you do as a developer when tackling a new platform is suss out tools.  Here's what I've found so far for Elixir:

* [Atom](https://atom.io)
* [Autocomplete for Elixir](https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-elixir)  I'm still sticking to my beloved TextMate for Elixir development but this is tempting.  Better autocomplete may be the killer app for Elixir development.
* [Dash for Documentation](https://kapeli.com/dash) (obligatory shout out to [Sonny Scrogson](https://github.com/scrogson/) for teaching a great course and showing me Dash)
* [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) (for testing JSON apis you build with Elixir)  Courtesy of [Dv](http://dasari.me)
* [Wombat](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/products/wombat-oam.html) for Elixir / Erlang Monitoring
* [HoneyBadger](https://www.honeybadger.io/for/elixir/) for managing Elixir errors


Other great Elixir resources include:

* [Phoenix Framework](http://www.phoenixframework.org)
* [The Phoenix Book](https://pragprog.com/book/phoenix/programming-phoenix)
* [The Elixir Book](https://pragprog.com/book/elixir13/programming-elixir-1-3)
