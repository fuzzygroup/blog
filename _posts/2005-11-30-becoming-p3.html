<p>Its time to become a P^3 person.  I mean I know Perl, I know PHP.  Why not *drum roll* Python?</p>
<ol>
<li>Download <a href="http://python.org/download/">Python 2.4</a>.  Done.</li>
<li>Ask knowledgeable <a href="http://www.grumet.net/">Python Person</a> "What Gui Framework?".  "WxWindows".  <a href="http://www.wxpython.org/download.php#binaries">Download</a>.  Done.</li>
<li>Open obligatory 2 year old Python book that my wonderful wife gave me as a present back in 2003.  Read first chapter.  Done.</li>
<li>Type "Hello World" into Idle.  Done.</li>
<li>Plan first project. Make it something I need. Ah yes. Got it. Need to research if its viable in Python. Requires a tree control, launching external apps under Windows, getting a process ID and an edit control. Should be viable.</li>
<li>Write first blog entry about Learning Python to force myself to follow through on it.  Done.</li>
</ol>
<p>Heh. Feels good to be geeky again. P^3 is the goal I say, P^3. Hm... Given that in another age I did prolog can that make me already P^3 or does code you last wrote in 1987 not count anymore ?</p>
