<font size="+1"><b>Mandrake 8.2: 85% Icky Poo (that's Bad), IMHO</b></font>

**NOTE:** There is no way that this doesn't come off as negative.&nbsp; I so didn't want that.&nbsp; I've always heard good things about Mandrake and shelled out $39.95 in the hopes that it would really work.&nbsp; Sigh.&nbsp; Hopefully someone at Mandrake will see this and use it constructively.&nbsp; Making these things public sometimes helps.

People I really respect have always told me good things about Mandrake.&nbsp; So in my current quest for an operating system that will support my ThinkPad since Windows 2K does not (see here), I picked up a copy of Mandrake&nbsp;8.2.&nbsp; Rarely, if ever, has a Unix variant been so disappointing.&nbsp; I've now installed it 4 times and I can feel a 5th time coming on later today.&nbsp; My specific issues:

1. **PCMCIA Support is Interesting**.&nbsp; If it can't recognize a PCMCIA device at install time, it doesn't load the PCMCIA support code so you end up having to recompile to get it going.&nbsp; Silly.  
  
2. **No drivers for WiFi**.&nbsp; Understandable.&nbsp; Annoying but understandable.&nbsp; I downloaded them and will try and install them later when my pain threshold is higher.  
  
3. **Do Not Do a Custom Install**.&nbsp; Accept the defaults!&nbsp; I went through and customized down to the individual package level.&nbsp; It worked -- sort of.&nbsp; I ended up with a deceptively working system.&nbsp; Yes it started up fine and seemed ok.&nbsp; But when I tried to address the PCMCIA problem in #1, I found out that I was missing cpp0 - a software tool you need to install pretty much ANYTHING.&nbsp; After messing around a bit, I came to the rapid conclusion that it was easier to just plain re-install.  
  
4. **Install Ximian Desktop**. I highly recommend installing the [www.ximian.com](http://www.ximian.com/) desktop over the top of Mandrake 8.2.&nbsp; I felt that I had a much better system after that (although some of this is because I am not fond over KDE).&nbsp; This gives you, among other things, Evolution the closest thing to Outlook under Linux.  
  
5. **Expect Network Updating to Fail**.&nbsp; At the end of the install, Mandrake 8.2 offers to update itself over the net with the latest and greatest.&nbsp; Very cool -- but it doesn't work, at least not for me.&nbsp; I ended up being unable to even get back to a prompt or even telnet into the system to restart it.&nbsp; Nothing quite as frightening as turning off a running Unix box.&nbsp; Thankfully an automatic fsck cleared up any problems -- but I did hold my breath.  
  
6. **The 1st Time User Wizard is Buggy**.&nbsp; When you first log on, they walk you through initial configuration steps and prompt you to sign up for the MandrakeExpert website.&nbsp; They even spawn a browser window to enable this.&nbsp; It would be so much better if the browser window allowed you to click into the fields in the web page and enter data -- you literally can't.&nbsp; That's usually better although maybe it's just me.  
  
7. **DVD Playback is Interesting**.&nbsp; Xine did not work for playing back DVDs although I was able to see still images and hear the DVD, actual video was missing.&nbsp; But, as with the dancing bear, it's not how well he dances but that he dances at all.&nbsp; Given all the issues in this area, that's very cool.&nbsp; NOTE:&nbsp; I just discovered that this is actually correct -- you have to download something else called the D4D plugin to get DVDs to play back.&nbsp; This is the whole DECSS thing smacking me in the head.&nbsp; Sigh.  
  
8. **Standard Things Seem to Be Missing**.&nbsp; For example locate isn't installed by default so you have to use find which is slower and there is no .xinitrc file so I can't, for the life of me, figure out how it knows where the Window Manager is.  
  
9. **The C Compiler Don't Work**.&nbsp; Even after multiple installs and choosing the development tools option every time, I just found out that the C compiler doesn't work.&nbsp; For a \*nix box this is a huge deal as a lot of things require this.&nbsp;   
  
10. **Don't Expect the Website to Work**.&nbsp; After #6 I figured -- well I can use Internet Explorer to register so I can get support.&nbsp; Yeah right.&nbsp; When I went here: [http://www.mandrakeexpert.com/login2.php](http://www.mandrakeexpert.com/login2.php), I got this:   
  
**Warning** : Can't connect to MySQL server on 'tiburon' (111) in **/var/www/include/phplib/php/db\_mysql.inc** on line **75**  

**Database error:** pconnect(tiburon, cremeuser, $Password) failed.  
**MySQL Error** : ()  
Session halted.  
  
10 1/2 hours later -- I tried it again (just as I typed the above section), by going to: [http://www.mandrakeexpert.com/index1.php?tab=signup](http://www.mandrakeexpert.com/index1.php?tab=signup)&nbsp;and filling out the options.&nbsp; I again got the exact same error.&nbsp; Hello!&nbsp; Systems Monitoring!&nbsp; Hello!&nbsp;&nbsp; You know it's really sad when small open source projects like [www.drupal.org](http://www.drupal.org/) do a far better job of keeping things running than these larger efforts.

### Positive Things

I made a lot of negative points.&nbsp; Let me comment on one other thing -- it's about 90% certain that this is what will run my laptop for at least the next month.&nbsp; Once you are past the initial "hit head against wall" problems, it's not so bad.&nbsp; So while I may not love it, I am using it and have even started installing software and adding my own data (a sure sign that I'm going to stay with it unless it blows up really, really bad).&nbsp; Once I added Ximian Desktop over the top of Mandrake 8.2, it just plain "felt better".&nbsp; And that isn't to say that I'm in love with Ximian either.&nbsp; For example -- there is no apparent way to change the Window Manager over to Enlightenment, nor can I find even a clue how to change my overall Gnome theme.&nbsp;

Other nice things -- A built in AIM compatible instant messaging program, GAIM, Yahoo Messenger works ok once you get past the seg faults on install (tip: do not have it install itself into the menus and you are ok), it's so wonderful to once again have virtual desktops that I can't even describe it, Galeon, a new Mozilla Gecko based browser, is actually really good.&nbsp; It's a lot faster than Mozilla and even integrates a built in Google search box.&nbsp;

### Closing Thoughts

Unlike [www.lycoris.com](http://www.lycoris.com/) which I looked at last weekend (a sign of an alpha geek:&nbsp; installs Linux distributions on&nbsp;a Friday night and then critiques them over the weekend), Mandrake is a "name brand" distribution.&nbsp; This means that software is much more readily available for it.&nbsp; Lycoris is based on the Caldera distribution which has fallen a bit out of favor so less software is available for it.&nbsp; And I know that there shouldn't be different software builds since it's all still Linux -- tell that to ISVs like Yahoo who have 4 different build of Yahoo Instant Messenger or Ximian which has 3 builds of Ximian Desktop.&nbsp; It may be icky but it's the current reality.

Bottom Line?&nbsp; If you really, really want desktop \*nix?&nbsp; Buy a Mac running OS X.  
I'm still not sure if it's for me but that's my recommendation.
