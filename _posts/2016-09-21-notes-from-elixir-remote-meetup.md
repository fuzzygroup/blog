A few notes that came out of the Elixir Remote Meetup:

* Chrome has audio issues; I was pointed to [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/?lang=en_US) by a very helpful soul and that Chromium based browser fixed it.  Thanks!
* Great talk on Supervisors
* [Great talk on Parallel Execution](https://github.com/saaji/ex_par_execute)
* [There's a recording you can watch!](https://www.bigmarker.com/remote-meetup/Elixir-Remote-Meetup-3)

Thanks to Josh Adams of Elixir Sips and the Daily Drip for hosting this.

Suggestion to Josh Adams - Get a tshirt with your branding on it.  Wear it every time (the hat clearly bothered you but branding needs to be consistent to be effective).
