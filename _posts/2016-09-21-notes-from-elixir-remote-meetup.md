A few notes that came out of the Elixir Remote Meetup:

* Chrome has audio issues; I was pointed to [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/?lang=en_US) by a very helpful soul and that Chromium based browser fixed it.  Thanks!
* [Great talk on Supervisors](https://elixir-lang.slack.com/files/seancribbs/F2DTLM9PC/supervisors_links_monitors_-_sean_cribbs.pdf)
* [Great talk on Parallel Execution](https://github.com/saaji/ex_par_execute) [PDF](https://elixir-lang.slack.com/files/seancribbs/F2DTLM9PC/supervisors_links_monitors_-_sean_cribbs.pdf)
* There's a slack room on [elixir-lang.slack.com](http://elixir-lang.slack.com) if you want to join
* [There's a recording you can watch!](https://www.bigmarker.com/remote-meetup/Elixir-Remote-Meetup-3)

Thanks to Josh Adams of Elixir Sips and the Daily Drip for hosting this.

Suggestion to Josh Adams - Get a tshirt with your branding on it.  Wear it every time (the hat clearly bothered you but branding needs to be consistent to be effective).
