<font size="+1"><b>Marketing 101: How to Handle a Difficult Sales Call -- Perfectly!</b></font>

Like a lot people out there today, I download and install **a lot** of software.&nbsp; I think that sometimes a week doesn't go by when I don't download something new.&nbsp; And, yes, the vendors do ask for phone numbers sometime.&nbsp; Perhaps surprisingly to you, I don't always lie about.&nbsp; Any kind of person to person interaction gives a chance to learn something new.&nbsp; Also, when you work from, with cats, you don't always get the "socialization" that you might want.&nbsp; Anyway...&nbsp; Today I got a sales call from someone and they handled it **perfectly**.&nbsp; Honest to god -- perfectly.&nbsp;

So here's what happened.&nbsp; The phone rings and it was a David Leonard from Starbase, [www.starbase.com](http://www.starbase.com).&nbsp; I had downloaded CodeWright, a very, very powerful editor, about a week ago and he wanted to know how it was going.&nbsp; I won't say that I was rude but I will say that I was a bit harsh i.e. "I'm an ex-user from 5 or 6 years ago and I can't see what's been updated.&nbsp; It doesn't do X, Y, Z."&nbsp; David could have very easily said something like "Maybe the product isn't for you.&nbsp; Thanks for you time", hung up, and then thought "Fool!".&nbsp; He didn't.&nbsp; What he did was very simple but it worked.&nbsp; He did this:

1. He said something like (paraphrased, he did a much better job) "Well, CodeWright is a really powerful product, I think we do what you need, can I conference in a support person to assist?".&nbsp; I said "Sure".   
2. Tom Berkemeier from support got on the line immediately and, using the same gentle approach, pointed out that **every single one** of my objections was actually handled in the software.&nbsp; Do this, Do that, etc.&nbsp; And, even better, he was just as helpful and polite as David.   
3. At the end of the call David gave me all the contact info so I can get more assistance if I need it.

End result -- will I buy the product?&nbsp; I'm not certain but I now know that it does everything I need from an editor&nbsp;editor (open binary files, open files \> 600 megabytes in size (no, that's not a typo and yes, it does work), support PHP coloring, save to FTP servers, committ to CVS, etc).&nbsp;

David did an outstanding job -- he took a difficult customer, recognized that more technical assistance was needed, got it promptly, made sure my questions were answered and then put me in control for follow up.&nbsp;

This is a model to follow for your own sales calls.

And if You're Really Geeky: Here's the coolest feature I've seen yet in an editor -- Code Meeting, a peer to peer multi user IM session for reviewing code in groups.
