It always astonishes me just how nice, how caring and how giving people can be.&nbsp; This one really surprised me.&nbsp; I recently got an email from a woman, Libby, asking for some php help on one of my [PHP Beginner](http://www.phpbeginner.com/) articles.&nbsp; I know there are some mistakes in [that article](http://www.phpbeginner.com/columns/scott/authentication/) and I've been meaning to address them for some time.&nbsp; In her emails she kept referring to CT so I thought she was a Connecticut (CT) resident and that's where I grew up.&nbsp; We kept exchanging emails and I finally wrote two stories for her that I really haven't blogged at all (they aren't perfect either but they along with the first basically make it clear).&nbsp; Here are those:

- [http://radio.weblogs.com/0103807/stories/2002/08/01/phpBeginnerMoreOnSecurity.html](http://radio.weblogs.com/0103807/stories/2002/08/01/phpBeginnerMoreOnSecurity.html)&nbsp;(this one is funny to read I've been told even if you aren't a programmer or hate php; it's a very different style for me) 
- [http://radio.weblogs.com/0103807/stories/2002/08/13/phpBeginnerMoreOnSecurity2.html](http://radio.weblogs.com/0103807/stories/2002/08/13/phpBeginnerMoreOnSecurity2.html)

I ultimately got her to get an IM account to make my helping her easier and it turns out that she's from South Africa and to her CT = Cape Town.&nbsp; Too funny.&nbsp; No wonder there's such an odd time synchronicity (since my schedule is so odd lately, I'm quasi in sync with her).&nbsp; We should be way, way out of sync.&nbsp; Anyway....

It turns out that Libby is a professional web master&nbsp;and photographer.&nbsp; She's also the creator of two neat, neat sites (links at the end; bear with me).&nbsp; Libby is climbing the PHP learning curve and, like any missionary, I'm happy to help addict her to the happy, flavorful goodness that is PHP.&nbsp; If, after saying that, you have an image of me hanging out on dim street corners, wearing a trench coat and offering free hits of PHP to potential users, you're not far off.&nbsp;

So, anyway, as this goes on, I find out the website for her photography and, just plain Wow!&nbsp; She seems to specialize in black and white images which are pretty much my favorite.&nbsp; Here's a sample:

"[Pensive](http://www.goafrica.co.za/shutter/gallery8/photo7.stm)"

Now, here's where the **wonderful niceness** from Libby comes in.&nbsp; A friend of my family is a huge photo enthusiast; that's her passion.&nbsp; And she really, really loves black and white images -- I mean a lot.&nbsp; She also is suffering from pretty bad cancer.&nbsp; Hence this uncharacteristic blog [essay](http://radio.weblogs.com/0103807/stories/2002/07/16/dealingWithLossAndDifficultTimes.html)&nbsp;back in July.&nbsp; And, if you have ever dealt with cancer, you know that the patient keeping up a good mood and attitude is essential.&nbsp; I knew that showing her photos will make her happy since it caters to her passion.&nbsp;&nbsp; What I did when I got back from seeing [Paolo](http://paolo.evectors.it/) in Italy was load our 200 odd digital pictures onto the iBook and then use iPhoto to make a slideshow.&nbsp; She just loved it.

So what I did was send Libby an email asking if she could possibly let me have, for non commercial one time use, the high resolution versions of her photos.&nbsp; I wanted to do the same thing but the low resolution images on the web site would just look grainy blown up on the iBooks nice screen.&nbsp; And I knew that this time my friend would be even happier since she's seen me before but this is a) new b) black and white and c) from a cool place.&nbsp; And, wouldn't you know, not only did Libby say yes, she did it promptly and even got me the captions for the images.&nbsp;

My friend was just thrilled when she saw them last night.&nbsp; So, while we see every day ethical collapses, stock manipulation, blatant greed, the stupidity of the RIAA, businesses cheating and lots of other just plain badness, remember this:

**People are Just Plain Nice All Over the World !**  
  
Thank You Libby

And, I have to also thank Apple for the just plain brilliance of the [iBook](http://www.apple.com/ibook/) and [iPhoto](http://www.apple.com/iphoto/).&nbsp; Here you have a notebook that's seems to be pretty much indestructible, a kick butt, stable operating system, a great screen, a 5 hour battery life and a brilliant photo application.&nbsp; It's just plain a wonderful notebook computer.&nbsp; This is what I recommend to friends as of late when they need a new computer.

**NOTE:** If you are wondering why I didn't just have my friend just go to Libby's web site, its really pretty simple.&nbsp; Think about when you are sick.&nbsp; How much do you feel like sitting in front of a terminal in a desk chair?&nbsp; This way she could sit on the couch and just have the slide show in front of her.&nbsp; It was a piece of a cake.&nbsp; And I didn't even have to take the power charger with me -- I have that much faith in the iBook's battery.
