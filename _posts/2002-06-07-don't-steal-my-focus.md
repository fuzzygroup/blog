### You're My PC -- I Am Not Your Human

Good morning.&nbsp; Any day that begins with waking up out of 4 1/2 hours of sound sleep with a new feature idea "What?&nbsp; Cool!&nbsp; Must try it now ..." is bound to lead to a rant.&nbsp; Perhaps a well thought out, well considered Rant, perhaps not.&nbsp; But&nbsp;a Rant none the less.&nbsp; So here goes ....

DON'T STEAL MY FOCUS!

Did you ever get the annoying feel that your PC is really in charge?&nbsp; Ever think that you are it's lowly servant?&nbsp; Guess what?&nbsp; Based on the respect it shows for you, I'd say that's right.&nbsp; Here's what I mean: it's all about focus.

Focus is a concept in computer GUI (graphical user interface) programming that indicates what object is currently in control or "has focus".&nbsp; Here's an example below.

![](http://www.scott.blogs.at/images/focus.gif)

In the picture above, the Find button has a dashed box around it.&nbsp;&nbsp; This indicates that it has focus.&nbsp; Any actions that take place will affect that object.&nbsp; For example, if you press ENTER then Find will be selected and a search will be performed.&nbsp; If you press TAB then the focus will shift to the Close button.&nbsp; I've heard GUI programmers talk for a long time about focus and they always go on and on and on about it.&nbsp; It's not magical.&nbsp; Not at all...

### I Have Focus Too

Here's why I don't think that focus is all that magical at all -- I have focus.&nbsp; I have had it my whole life.&nbsp; Focus is whatever I am doing at the present time.&nbsp; Here's an example:

1. 
You're programming away.&nbsp; Happy as a clam.&nbsp; In your text editor.&nbsp; Typing furiously, getting stuff done.&nbsp; Then.....
2. 
BOOM!&nbsp; There's another window up on screen!&nbsp; It's got the focus now.&nbsp; IT STOLE THE FOCUS -- FROM YOU.
3. 
Do the ALT+TAB dance back to your editor.&nbsp; Figure out what keystrokes didn't get in.&nbsp; Retype.&nbsp; Sigh.&nbsp; Until the next time.

This happens to me between 8 and 10 times per day.&nbsp; Here's my thinking on this:

- 
It's just plain rude!
- 
It's distracting!
- 
No offense Mr. Programmer -- it's my computer & it's my time.&nbsp; How dare you steal it from me!
- 
Let me go into your office and spin your chair away from the computer and see how you like it.&nbsp; THAT'S WHAT YOU JUST DID TO ME !!!(shouting intended)

This isn't to say that every application is like this -- Yahoo Messenger is actually surprisingly polite.&nbsp; Rather than pop up and piss you off, it flashes in the task bar and, may or may not, makes a noise.&nbsp; AOL AIM (which I do love to death) slaps me in the face and says (metaphorically) "BOY YOU ARE MINE! PAY ATTENTION".&nbsp;&nbsp; That's just a wee bit rude.&nbsp; But this isn't limited to Instant Messaging apps at all --- it's all over Windows at every turn.

### Conclusion

If there is a human factors expert out there that just happens to work at Microsoft -- you really need to think about this quite seriously.&nbsp; As we all use our PCs close to 18x7 (i.e. damn near all waking hours), this gets very, very annoying and distracting.&nbsp; Damn little on my PC is important enough to warrant stealing my attention.&nbsp; Repeat after me:

I am \_\_MUCH MORE IMPORTANT\_\_ than my PC.

I am NOT my PC's Human!

### Disclaimer: 

I did start this morning by listening to a combination of Dido & Enya.&nbsp; After the 1st&nbsp;5+ times I had my focus stolen by different apps (Outlook, etc), I switched to the lovely noise of "32 Garbage Pail Hits by the Angry Samoans".&nbsp; Yup, Punk.&nbsp; That's like going from quiet easy listening right start to heavy metal (only worse -- any Samoans listeners out there know the song I am referencing).&nbsp; No wonder this Rant just flew off my fingers.
