**NOTE:** Since I promised (or threatened) you with another case study and proclaimed how "easy" they are to write, it's only fair I guess that inspiration just struck me at 4:52 am on a Sunday like a hammer from above, forcing me to "do da blog" before I even hit the shower.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hmmmm.... \*Self deprecating chuckle issues from me\*&nbsp; \*Flash of insight -- Perhaps that's why I live alone.\*&nbsp; Need to think about that one.&nbsp; Anyway...

**To:** Anyone Awake in Product Planning At Palm, Inc. or Handspring  
**From:** An Ex-User Who Wants to Become a User Again But Needs a Different Type of Product from You  
**Re:** The New Product You Need to Make But Haven't Figured Out Yet  
**Date:** Way Too Early, Sunday August 4, 2002

Hi there.&nbsp; I don't mean to be rude.&nbsp; I'm an ex-product manager myself but I just had an epiphany about the product that you aren't making and I needed to tell you (well and the world).&nbsp; I've been a Palm owner since 1996 and I find myself using my Palm IIIx less and less and less.&nbsp; And I think you are missing something very important.&nbsp; Here's why -- but we're going to start with some facts and why I (used to) love my Palm.

## 0.&nbsp; A Basic Fact

I'm sorry to tell you this Palm and Handspring but here's a few facts that seem to have missed you completely:

1. I don't regularly carry a Palm anymore.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; See point #2. 
2. I HAVE TO carry a cell phone.&nbsp; It's utterly required that people be able to reach me.&nbsp; Sure some of this is my own compulsiveness but it's also a matter of safety (car trouble) and convenience.&nbsp; Carrying a Palm is a luxury right now, not a requirement.&nbsp; Sure it's nice to have my contact info and schedule with me.&nbsp; But it's not a requirement.&nbsp; Sad perhaps but true. 
3. The size of a cell phone matters -- a lot.&nbsp; I'm an unlikely candidate for a Samsung Palm Phone or a Treo.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; They're just too damn big and the requirement of these devices to do too much will forever keep them big.&nbsp; You're not making the product I want.&nbsp; Please read on and make me a happy Palm customer again.

## 1.&nbsp; Why Did Palm Rock !

Once upon a time there was a product named Palm.&nbsp; And it was good.&nbsp; It was good not just because it worked (although that was a rarity int the kingdom known as high technology) but because it **synced**.&nbsp; That's right it **synced**.&nbsp; The single best thing about Palm, at least to me, was HotSync.&nbsp; Drop it in a cradle.&nbsp; Press a button.&nbsp; **\*POOF\*** &nbsp; Your data is there.&nbsp; Changes are handled actually pretty well.&nbsp; You can do the bulk of your data entry on a PC, a platform really, really great at data entry, and then take your data with you.&nbsp; Sure you can add data to your palm as well but a lot of us didn't ever bother.&nbsp; If I had to wager, I'd say that 95+% of data on Palm devices came from a PC, not from the Palm itself.&nbsp; HotSync was wonderful and clearly the defining feature of the Palm.

## 2.&nbsp; What Made Me Stop Loving My Palm?

It was the summer of 1999, a hot, sticky summer if memory serves me correctly.&nbsp; The digitizer on my original Palm had given up the ghost and made recognition erratic.&nbsp; I gleefully used the failure to force myself to buy a new Palm IIIx (more RAM, faster processor, whee!!!).&nbsp; This was also when Palm switched HotSync software from Palm to Chapura.&nbsp; After first syncing, I discovered a NASTY bug -- every time I sync'd, my contacts would grow -- and the changes weren't uniformly replicated.&nbsp; I don't know why but I went from 250 odd contacts to 500 and then to 750.&nbsp; And, just like that, the magic for me was gone.&nbsp; By the time I noticed, the&nbsp;effort of cleaning up my contacts folder (you try weeding all your contacts down to just 1 copy of each when there are now 1 or 2 differences per changed contact and it's not apparent which one has the change).&nbsp; The **pain** that was this bug basically switched me from a Palm user to a Palm owner.&nbsp; From time to time I'd use my Palm but I basically moved my important phone numbers to my cell phone and never trusted my Palm again.&nbsp;

**NOTE:** Yes I know that there might have been a bug fix.&nbsp; So what?&nbsp; The amount of time that Palm cost me was greater than the perceived value of the device as a whole.&nbsp; I simply didn't want to take the risk.&nbsp; I strongly thought about packing it in a box filled with dead toads and limburger cheese and then shipping it back to headquarters "Attention Product Testing Department" but a vestige of that thing I call sanity prevailed.&nbsp; Pity.

Still I liked my Palm and thought about it from time to time.&nbsp; I watched the emergence of Handspring, the creation of the ridiculously large Samsung Palm phone and the Treo.&nbsp; But I didn't buy again.

## 3.&nbsp; The New Product Palm Needs to Make

I just got YANCP, **yet another new cell phone,** and I am now doing the "MKIPNWCTPL" dance- (that's **manually keying in phone numbers while cursing the phone loudly)**.&nbsp; I mean, really.&nbsp; Does anyone enjoy that "Press 2 the times for the letter C" crap?&nbsp; Here's what Palm needs to make: **SyncPhone**.&nbsp; What is it?&nbsp; Is it a Treo like device?&nbsp; Does it do email?&nbsp; Does it do Grafitti? Nope.&nbsp;All I want is a damn standard cell with a cradle and HotSync.&nbsp; Let me easily move a subset of contact info to it quickly and easily and take the #s I do add&nbsp;to the phone via MKIPNWCTPL back to Outlook.&nbsp; I know this isn't a technology challenge at all.&nbsp; I know it's only a cell phone with a USB connector and less software than you've ever shipped in a product.&nbsp; So what!&nbsp; Selling products is about solving a customer problem.&nbsp; And HotSync brilliantly solved a huge problem.&nbsp; You need to recognize this and solve this product for your customers.

Give it HotSync, a cradle and USB support and it's **SyncPhone:**

(Yup.&nbsp; I'm now a happy Nextel customer)

Note what's missing -- no big screen, no keyboard, no stylus, etc.&nbsp; It's just a damn phone with a cable.&nbsp; That's all I want.

## 4.&nbsp; Here's Another Reason Why You Need to Make This Product

And besides the fact that you'd sell a LOT of these, there's another reason to make this product: People buy new cell phones a LOT more frequently than PDAs.&nbsp; I'm still carrying, and occasionally using,&nbsp;a Palm IIIx (bought in 1999 no less) but I've had 4 cell phones since (dropped one out a car window), changed plans 3 times, etc.&nbsp; Sure I had a bad experience which biased me against upgrading my Palm but the new features of a PDA just aren't that compelling to force the regular upgrade that&nbsp;Pam needs for greater&nbsp;revenue.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just the ability to change your billing plan alone will force you to ugprade your cell&nbsp;phone regularly.&nbsp; So not only can you (hopefully) get a piece of the call revenue but you also can benefit from this upgrade potential.&nbsp; And, since cell phones are carried EVERYWHERE these days, they are used harder than PDAs which leads to breakage and replacement revenues.&nbsp; And we'll all need additional sync cables, chargers and such.

## Conclusion

Make my next cell phone a SyncPhone.

## Conclusion 2

Yes there are some phones out there that are kind of sync'able.&nbsp; I do know this.&nbsp; My point with this essay is as follows:

- Solve the problem customers actually have, not the problems that you perceive (it's about Sync not about total functionality; I don't need Notes and Calendar on a cell phone, my phone #s are just fine, thank you very much) 
- Lots and lots of technology isn't always good (SyncPhone is easy) 
- Markets evolve and products need to evolve with them (in 96 cell phones mattered less so you carried your #s with you and called from a land line; now you use a cell phone) 
- Palm has a trusted brand with HotSync and millions of users who think it works.&nbsp; This can be leveraged into an entirely new business. 
- Size matters.&nbsp; And in this case, smaller is better.

Note: Elapsed time, start to finish, about 53 minutes.&nbsp; Very cool.
