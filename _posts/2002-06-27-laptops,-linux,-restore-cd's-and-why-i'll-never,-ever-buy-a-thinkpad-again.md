Disclaimer: I don't want this to seem as whining.&nbsp; It's just an interesting commentary on the state of our PC's now (IMHO), options to Windows and the things that can lead to a platform shift.&nbsp;

I tell you -- 22 + years of using PC based hardware and I've NEVER had an experience like the past month -- machines down, hard drives crashing, OS failures, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;If it's bad and it involves computers I've probably had it in the last month.&nbsp; As I said to someone via IM last night:

> fuzzygroup: It's just been like an anvil was dropped on me  
> fuzzygroup: and then a piano.  
> fuzzygroup: lately it's been big rocks   
> [sekaup](http://www.sooz.com/): sounds fun.&nbsp; or not.  
> fuzzygroup: but that's ok.&nbsp; Builds Character.

But... It's ok.&nbsp; I feel like I now have attained a state of " **Zen and the Loss of Data**".&nbsp; I'm pretty much backed up at all times which is always good.&nbsp; I'm better than ever at data recovery and disaster recovery (never bad) and even losing a hard drive doesn't bother me.&nbsp;

As of this morning I now have a Linux laptop, NOT a windows laptop.&nbsp; The way I got to Linux was bizarre and involved a failure on the part of both IBM and Microsoft.&nbsp; So here are some thoughts on ThinkPads and why I'll never go back as well as how I got to Linux:

1. Love the hardware.&nbsp; Small, light, cool, stylish. 
2. Unreliable at the hard drive level.&nbsp; On 2 thinkpads I am now on my 4th hard drive.&nbsp; My 1st ThinkPad's PCMCIA slots just died as if by magic.&nbsp; And a USB network adaptor basically sucks. 
3. When my last hard drive died the first time, I figured it was just a random thing and reinstalled from scratch.&nbsp; When it failed again, literally 5 minutes before a client demo, I figured "Hmmmm.&nbsp; Probably a bad idea to use that drive again".&nbsp; A quick trip to the wonderful, wonderful folks at [www.cablesonline.com](http://www.cablesonline.com/) got me a replacement drive. 
4. IBM's own web site recommends a 30 gig drive as the replacement for the original 20 gig drive.&nbsp; So that's what I got. 
5. I installed it, did the recovery CD and all was goodness, sunshine and happiness.&nbsp; I felt as if I was about to stroll the elysian fields of wireless notebook computing again. 
6. Of course the 1st thing you do is install your software and data.&nbsp; I began that less than pleasant task and felt cool. 
7. BANG!&nbsp; BOOM!&nbsp; "Out of Disc Space!".&nbsp; "Bizarre" I thought.&nbsp; It's a 30 gig drive.&nbsp; 
8. Actually, no.&nbsp; According to Windows it's now a&nbsp;2 gig drive. 
9. Ah... BIOS needs to be updated.&nbsp; And I know that this means that I'm pretty much hosed again -- I'll have to redo the Restore CD and then reinstall software and such.&nbsp; Wonderful. NOT. 
10. So a few days go by and then I have the time to flash the BIOS and then update the other required things like the core drivers 
11. So I'm all ready to run the Restore CD.&nbsp;&nbsp; It goes through the process -- but doesn't actually restore anything.&nbsp; It looks like it does it but the machine still boots into Windows 2K with&nbsp;a 2 gig partition. 
12. After trying 2 x more, it finally dawns on me that the issue has to be the new drive.&nbsp; I.e. the restore CD doesn't know what to do with the 30 gig drive. 
13. I think about the prospect of calling IBM support, waiting for a new restore CD (if one is even available).&nbsp; Or the option of going to the store and buying a new copy of XP.&nbsp; I absolutely refuse to buy a new copy of XP.&nbsp; I'm an MSDN member, I paid my $1,000, and I have about 1,000 CDs from Microsoft including a full edition of XP -- but not a bootable CD (at least to my knowledge).&nbsp; This means that the best I could do would be to revert to some other MS OS, upgrade it to XP and then spent N hours/days combing IBM's web site for the different hardware drivers (Laptops are funky with respect to drivers).&nbsp; I've done this before and it always borders on nightmarish at best. 
14. I happened to burn a CD of [Lycoris / Redmond Linux](http://www.lycoris.com/) about 2 sundays ago just really on a whim.&nbsp; I figured "The machine's toast anyway" so why not blow away the hard drive and just see how it installs at least. 
15. Guess what?&nbsp; Flawless.&nbsp; Bloody well flawless.&nbsp; In about 1/2 hour it installed perfectly (although it didn't find my sound card) and it did find my drive, all 30 gigs of it.&nbsp; It's about as easy a Linux distribution as I've found. 

So here's what I found really bad about all this:

1. Well the whole process.&nbsp; Still bad things happen and everyone has a string of bad luck at times.&nbsp; It's not that big a deal honestly -- I didn't lose more than a few K of data at most, no one died, no one was injured and I didn't even get all that angry.&nbsp; In the grand scheme this is really not all that bad. 
2. IBM recommending something as&nbsp; a replacement without commenting that it was NOT supported by the restore CD.&nbsp; I will admit though that I was in a rush and I could have missed it.&nbsp; When you need a new hard drive and you're in a hurry this does happen. 
3. The Restore CD was definitely a problem.&nbsp; It should have looked at the drive and figured out that it was a different size than supported.&nbsp; At least a warning would have been nice. 
4. The real problem was this: IBM / Microsoft **DOESN'T SHIP THE CDs FOR WHAT YOU PAID FOR**.&nbsp; With my laptop I paid for a Windows 2K license.&nbsp; I don't have the CDs for it and now, when I need them most, I'm hosed.&nbsp; If this was a budget laptop I could accept it but when I bought it, IBM had just released it and it was top of the line.&nbsp; I look at this as buying a Mercedes and getting a 2 cylinder lawnmower&nbsp;engine under the hood.&nbsp; Sure there may well be an option to call / write IBM and get the CDs after I buy the Laptop but this puts the burden on the customer NOT the vendor.&nbsp; I gave them the $$$ -- why didn't they give me what I paid for?  
  
**NOTE** : One of the really appealing things about an iBook as an alternative is that Apple seems to understand that CDs may suck but they are necessary.&nbsp; It's that whole complete user experience that Apple understands and Microsoft doesn't seem to get.

## Conclusion

So -- Net Result -- I have an extended business trip to Europe (Italy / Venice) in 2 weeks and I don't even know if I'll have a machine that I'm really comfortable with.&nbsp; The next step is, of course, to figure out exactly what I need to do with a latop and map that matrix onto a Linux laptop and see if it works for me or if I need to really go back to Windows.&nbsp; I use \*nix on the server side daily so running it on my laptop isn't such a big deal.

I'll definitely never, ever, ever buy a ThinkPad again.&nbsp; Dell perhaps.&nbsp; ThinkPad?&nbsp; Nope.&nbsp; It wouldn't surprise me if IBM has fixed this problem but thrice (actually four but fourice sounds bad) burned, never again.&nbsp; I would point out to people the following things:

- Desktop Linux really does work.&nbsp; Lycoris had as easy an install as Windows setup.&nbsp; It even let me play Solitaire while it was installing.&nbsp; How cool is that? 
- The windowing interface on Linux can be gorgeous -- I have transparency and 24 bit color and I didn't do anything to get them.&nbsp; it was automatic.&nbsp; 
- Downloading a Linux distribution isn't a big deal if you have a cable modem.&nbsp; I did it in about 2 hours and even burned a 3 disc set. 
- I'm not certain that I'll stick with Lycoris.&nbsp; It's cool, don't get me wrong, but [www.gentoo.org](http://www.gentoo.org) looks to make installing stuff much easier than the classical RedHat RPM model (which basically sucks rocks). 
- Linux hardware detection, traditionally an absolute bear, is actually a lot better than you think.&nbsp; Yes my sound card wasn't detected but I've had this with Windows quite often as well.&nbsp; And this was a laptop which is always funky. 
- There are real options out there.&nbsp; Yes you will work at it but it really is viable.&nbsp; I wouldn't give my Mom Linux but I would give her OS X.
