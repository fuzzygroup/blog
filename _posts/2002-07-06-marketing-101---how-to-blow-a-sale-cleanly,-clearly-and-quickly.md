<font size="+1"><b>Marketing 101 : How to Blow a Sale Cleanly, Clearly and Quickly</b></font>

**NOTE:** I held off writing this until I had the postscript to the story, which happened last night at 6:20 pm approximately.&nbsp; Details follow at the bottom.

I just put my house on the market and I did the obligatory task of getting bids from two agencies.&nbsp; One was a little tiny agency, the town real estate company, no web site, no nothing.&nbsp; The other was Hunneman, a Coldwell Banker company, one of the largest agencies in the nation.&nbsp; Betty was the agent from the little company, Nahant Associates and Sheila was the agent from Hunneman.&nbsp; Here were the constraints:

- I called them on in early July (same day for both) and said "I want to sell my house.&nbsp; I leave for Europe on Monday (this was the preceding Tuesday)&nbsp;and I'll be ready by then.&nbsp; I want a price and a marketing plan as quickly as possible". 
- I want to sell it quickly (it's just time for a change)

Here were the differences between the two approaches:

Betty:

- Showed up the next day with everyone from her office for the full detailed tour (I had 4 agents looking in all the myriad nooks and crannies) 
- Got back to me with an extensive proposal within 24 hours 
- Recommended a price of $699,000 as the asking price 
- Very upfront and honest

Sheila:

- Showed up with one other person 
- Got a proposal to me within 72 hours 
- Proposal was about 1/3 the size 
- Price of $599,000 (that's a big difference)

Made two fatal errors:

- Tried to convince me that a key advantage of her agency was their "Premier Brochure" which only goes out to "high end clients".&nbsp; She then hemmed and hawed about my getting into it.&nbsp; That's very cool so I clearly wanted to be in it so I asked 2 key questions.&nbsp; 
  - Q: "How often does it come out?" 
  - A: "Quarterly" 
  - Q: "When did it last come out?" 
  - A: "It just did"

So lets play with this a bit -- She wanted me to think that a key advantage is something that I can't even get into for 3 months?&nbsp; That either says to me that she is a) Trying to scam me or b) that she is, well, clue free and proud of it.&nbsp; It just smells too much of the aroma of "bait and switch".&nbsp; So while I wasn't very happy with her, I continued talking and didn't disclose my raging anger (nothing like someone trying to pull the wool over your eyes when the $$$ amounts are \> 1/2 million.

And then it got worse.&nbsp; As she was leaving my house, she turned around and made a comment to the effect of "You do have a lot of work to do, are you sure you'll be ready?".&nbsp; Sigh.&nbsp; First she basically lies to me and then she insults me?&nbsp; Brilliant move there.&nbsp; Talk about customer alienation at it's finest.

### Marketing Rule to Learn from This

If I had so make some generalizations from this it would be these:

1. People are smarter than you think they are -- particularly when the $$$ amounts are large.&nbsp; And, while "large" varies, it generally means \> $1,000 for personal purchases and $5,000 for business purchases. 
2. In this current economic meltdown and utter collapse of any and all business ethics, ethics are more important than ever.&nbsp; Betty was very honest with me when she said "You might be able to get more for the house but if you really want to sell it quickly (and I did) then this is the price I recommend but you make the decision". 
3. Small companies and person to person interaction really do matter.&nbsp; When it came right down to it I chose Betty over Sheila based on trust, not price.

### Conclusion

Betty was very honest with me.&nbsp; Her office is literally walking distance to my house and I just plain trust her.&nbsp; Sure her price was higher but the fact that I feel that Sheila basically either lied to me or tried to scam me or just was&nbsp;clue free herself.&nbsp; I went with Betty because I trusted her.

### Postscript

Well exactly 7 days later I got a bid for $650,000 (that's only 7% under asking in a crappy economy) contingent on inspection and such as these always are (never, ever count your chickens in real estate until the proverbial rotund female sings an aria).&nbsp; Sure it could all fall through but I clearly mad the right decision.
