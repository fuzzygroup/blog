Well a new year and people are still unhappy about the state of the Mac.  Here are some interesting links worth following:

* [Apple 2016 in Review](https://chuqui.com/2017/01/apples-2016-in-review/) [HN Commentary](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13307040)  His point on Apple relying on data too much is likely correct.
* [Regular Restarts on OSX](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13307648)  Yep.  Right there with you.  Even my brand new box had to be restarted today after only 10 days of uptime.
* [Warm Takes on Microsoft's Surface Pro 4](https://medium.com/@searls/warm-takes-on-microsofts-surface-pro-4-580f77634d2c#.7ix3536dx)  All I can say here is that I have an equivalent setup to my OSX box on Linux for my daily work and I've had a far easier time than he has.  Overall a fantastic read.
* [Using a ThinkPad for Development under Linux](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13299585) (good discussion of gear and options here and also on the [X1 Carbon article](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13286150))
