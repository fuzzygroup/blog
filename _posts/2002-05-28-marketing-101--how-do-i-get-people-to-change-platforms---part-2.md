## Changing Platforms: Practice

This article is a follow up piece to the Marketing 101 article: **[How Do I Get People to Change Platforms](http://scott.blogs.at/stories/2002/05/28/marketing101HowDoIGetPeopleToChangePlatforms.html)?**&nbsp; In this article we are going to illustrate the platform changing process with [Drupal](http://www.drupal.org/).

Drupal is a new Open Source application that is a current passion of mine.&nbsp; When I first discovered it, I thought:

It's a blogging tool.

Then I realized that it was more and I thought:

It's a blogging tool + Slashdot and Scoop

Then I realized:

It's just Drupal (a quote from Kjartan, a team lead)

In the end I realized that Drupal is a platform for building web sites.&nbsp; That's all.&nbsp; You can do lots with it since it's a platform.&nbsp; Here are some of the standard features:

- Blogging 
- Discussion forums 
- News Aggregator for RSS Input 
- RSS Output 
- Event log 
- Robust Security Model 
- Distributed Authentication 
- Theme Architecture 
- Multi User Threaded Comments 
- Polls 
- ... (I haven't found anything I want that isn't in Drupal, to be very honest)

So, in discussions with [Kjartan](http://www.natrak.net/), I proposed that Drupal use this approach to build awareness and ease the platform change process.

1. **Leave Your Pride at the Door**.&nbsp; Let's face it -- creative people are proud.&nbsp; I know my next suggestions are a&nbsp;bit radical so just put that pride away for now. 
2. **Don't Try for 100% Adoption.** &nbsp; It's really hard to get people to change things.&nbsp; They just hate it.&nbsp; So why require an all or nothing approach?&nbsp; Most platforms have lots of features.&nbsp; Can you look at your platform as something to be adopted bit by bit? 
3. **Look at Drupal as an Exportable Engine**.&nbsp; Drupal is a very, very rich product.&nbsp; It has integral features like polls and comments that, to put it mildly, blow the doors off the other available options (if they even exist).&nbsp; My suggestions&nbsp;were: 
  - Most blogging products lack polls.&nbsp; Let Drupal be available as a hosted polling system so that polls could be added to blogs. 
  - Most blogging products have fairly simple comment implementations.&nbsp; For example, no threading, no notification, no comments on stories, etc.&nbsp; Let Drupal be available as a hosted commetn engine so that comments could be added to blogs.

With this approach you coax people into Drupal gradually, not all at once.&nbsp; And, once people trust you for one element of a system, they are more likely to adopt it at a larger level.&nbsp;

So, anyone out there want this?&nbsp; Certainly there is Yaccs for commenting but no polling solutions.&nbsp; Anyone think I should release webservices called Blog.poll and Blog.comment?

(Oh and just a comment, it's not just me, alone in a room,&nbsp;on all these whacky code things, there are other people associated with me).
