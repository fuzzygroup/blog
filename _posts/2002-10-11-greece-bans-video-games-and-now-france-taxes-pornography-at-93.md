<p>France to Slap 93 Percent 'Supertax' on Porn Films<br>Fri Oct 11, 8:21 AM ET</font></p>
<p>PARIS (Reuters) - The French government will hike taxes on profits from sexually explicit films to 93 percent as part of an anti-pornography drive by ruling conservatives. </font></p>
<p>This was one of several proposals to fight pornography to emerge from the center-right majority elected in June. Several deputies want to ban X-rated films from television, but others in the conservative ranks oppose this as censorship. </font></p>
<p>"Our aim is to make this sector financially unattractive," right-wing parliament deputy Charles de Courson told Le Figaro daily on Friday after parliament's finance committee agreed his initiative would be applied from January 1 next year. </font></p>
<p>Courson said the measure would raise to 60 percent from 33 percent a special tax already levied on profits from the production, distribution or showing of any French-made film deemed pornographic or an incitement to violence. </font></p>
<p>Once added to France's standard 33 percent tax on all corporate profits, French porn film-makers will be left with a mere seven percent of their profits net of tax. </font></p>
<p>"We want to destroy their profitability to discourage further investments," Courson said. </font></p>
