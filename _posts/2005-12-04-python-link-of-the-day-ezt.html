<p>Interesting.  I just finished a long IM chat with my buddy Greg and he pointed me towards <a href="http://svn.webdav.org/repos/projects/ezt/trunk/">EZT</a> as a templating library.  He wrote and, well, $geek_fu is no stronger than Greg's.  He and I tossed it around for a while and, without having coded with it, it feels very, very similar to my beloved SmartTemplate from <a href="http://www.smartphp.net/">SmartPhp</a>.  Every web page I've written for 3 years now has relied on SmartTemplate so finding an analog on Python increases my happy quotient dramatically.</p>
<p>We also shot the breeze on OR mappers and object dbs and that was interesting.  Good to know that I'm not the only one who thinks the way I do.  Its what I call me "Codd and Date"  manifesto:</p>
<blockquote><p>Data shall be stored in tables.  Period.  As Codd and Date handed it down from the heavens so shall it be.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_F._Codd">Wikipedia on Codd and Date</a> (well Codd at least)</p></blockquote>
<p>I could  also describe this in a way familiar to any Highlander freak:</p>
<blockquote><p>There shall be <strong>only</strong> Tables.</p></blockquote>
<p>Good stuff.  Thanks Greg!</p>
