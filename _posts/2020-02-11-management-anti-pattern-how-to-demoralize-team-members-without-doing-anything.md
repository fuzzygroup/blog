I have discovered a wonderful **anti pattern** for absolutely demoralizing team members in a remote context and it is drop dead simple:

> When you are someone's manager, simply **don't respond** to the things that they send you. 

The magic of this is as follows:

* It requires that you do absolutely **nothing**!
* It works whether you are not responding to Email, Slack or another method
* It entirely demoralizes even experienced, motivated team members

**Not Recommended**.

**Note**: If you're a manager, it is easy to fall into the trap of saying to yourself "Hm... This is **interesting**.  I need more time to respond to it" and then lose track of it in the ever growing flood of Slack / Email / Etc.  I'm sorry but that's just a *bullshite* excuse.  If something is actually interesting then your **responsibility** as a manager is to acknowledge it with "Thanks.  I need to think about this; will get back to you".  And if it isn't interesting to you then simply say that explicitly.  Leaving people hanging and wondering is a horrible approach to management.
