<p>A buddy of mine just IM'd me about cheap hosting in the US.&nbsp; His requirements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>non shared hosting i.e. dedicated server</li>
<li>a linux distro which doesn't have package management issues i.e. gentoo / debian / *bsd</li>
<li>a non astronomical monthly fee ( he needs at least 2 servers from day 1 to build a clustered architecture) </li>
<li>ssh access w/ some kind of decent web based admin tool like webmin</li>
<li>ability to do some kind of disc mirroring / heartbeat with drbd or something similar.&nbsp; This is a high reliability application but he can't afford to buy his own hardware*</li>
</ul>
<p>I've heard good things about <a href="http://www.serverbeach.com/">ServerBeach</a> but I don't know.&nbsp; Anyone have any thoughts?&nbsp; <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/">Niall</a>?&nbsp; Where's your box?&nbsp; <a href="http://www.feedblog.org/">Kevin</a> what do you use ? (and yes I could traceroute but I think its a good conversation to start)</p>
<p>*I know that's inconsistent on the face of it.&nbsp; Don't bug me about it.&nbsp; Bug him (oh crap; he requested anon)
