I have a number of friends who work on assembly lines and all of them are:

* Terrified of getting sick
* Have no option of working from home
* Want to work
* Need to work

Once upon a time my father used to own a manufacturing operation and this is the advice that I'd give him - buy these for all your line workers:

In the picture above, I am wearing my face shield that I use when I cut wood on my table saw.  It:

* Isn't a mask (and that's ok because there is a shortage of masks and masks aren't as effective as you would think)
* Costs only $15 at Menards or Home Depot
* Should be readily available as it isn't a medical device
* Qualifies as valid safety equipment since that is its purpose
* WILL REMIND PEOPLE TO NOT TOUCH THEIR FACE!

As an employer, whether or not you offer health care, you simply **don't want your employees getting sick**.  And I'm firmly of the belief that people are smart but often get distracted so giving them a visual reminder "don't touch your face" is probably helpful.
