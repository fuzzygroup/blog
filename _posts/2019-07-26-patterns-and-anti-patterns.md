There times when I use terms so common to software engineering that I forget that there is a wide audience out there to whom these aren't native concepts.  That's my bad -- using things before you define them is not a good thing.  

Earlier today I referenced "[anti-patterns](https://fuzzyblog.io/blog/anti_patterns/2019/07/26/development-anti-pattern-two-objects-with-almost-the-same-structure.html)" but failed to define it.  The idea of an anti-pattern is intimately tied to the idea of a pattern and let's let Wikipedia do the talking:

"In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system." [Software Design Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern)

So if a pattern is a best practice, something that you do then an anti-pattern is the inverse -- it is something that you **do not do**.  I'll blog about another one soon -- the going dark anti pattern.
