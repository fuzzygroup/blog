<p>My buddy Mike has a <a href="http://airhead.typepad.com/airhead/2005/11/earn_trust_dont.html">good review of BlinkSale</a>.  Its a typical example of how company's screw up customer service -- which happens -- and is, statistically, a damn near certainty if your company is of any size and volume.  Just do the math -- if you do enough transactions, you're going to screw things up.  The sad thing is that even being, ostensibly, a web company, they're apparently not monitoring the blogosphere -- or will they?  He only posted this a little while ago.  It'll be interesting to see if they ever comment on his blog.</p>
