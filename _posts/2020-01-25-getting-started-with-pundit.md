[Pundit](https://github.com/varvet/pundit), a Rails gem that my former boss, Taylor Williams, taught me is a tool for "simple, robust and scalable authorization system" and the more I play with authorization, the more true I find that.  This blog post lays out how to get started with Pundit with more details coming down the road.

I will freely admit that when Taylor taught me Pundit, I grokked about maybe 1/10th of 1/10th of what he taught me (the [project I worked on under Taylor](https://www.seaseducation.com/attain-info/) had a staggeringly complex security scheme).  What I found, once I started from scratch with Pundit, is that it is strikingly simple to understand and a huge improvement over former Rails security gems like CanCan.

## Security Basics: Authentication versus Authorization

There are two basic security concepts that often get tangled up together so let's start with the basics:

* Authentication - Should the user be allowed access into the **system**?
* Authorization - Should the user be granted permission to do **something** with a **item** within the **system**?

It should be noted that:

* system
* something
* item

are all not defined.  That's actually intentional at this point because we need to work in terms of abstractions and all of those are abstract.

## Installing Pundit

Here's what you have to do:

1. Add it into Gemfile i.e. gem "pundit"
2. Add it into application_controller.rb i.e. include Pundit
3. Run the pundit generator: rails g pundit:install
4. Restart your server

## Using Pundit

The way that Pundit works is that authorization is handled at the Rails controller level via an **authorize** statement like this:

```ruby
# GET /projects
def index
  @pagy, @projects = pagy(current_user.projects.order("id DESC"))
  authorize @projects
end
```

So you make an instance variable of what you want to display in your HTML view template and then you authorize it via Pundit.  The authorization is then defined by a Policy file stored in /app/policies/classname_policy.rb.  Here's an example for the project.rb class:

```ruby
class ProjectPolicy < ApplicationPolicy
  attr_reader :user, :project

  def initialize(user, project)
    @user = user
    @project = project
  end

  # Inheriting from the application policy scope generated by the generator
   class Scope < Scope
     def resolve
       if user.admin?
         scope.all
       else
         scope.where(active: true)
       end
     end
   end

  def index?
    valid_user?
  end
  
  # this ilustrates that the user MUST be logged in and 
  # that the owner of the data has to be the logged in user
  def show?
    valid_user? && project.user == user
  end

  def edit?
    valid_user?
  end

  def new?
    valid_user?
  end

  def create?
    valid_user?
  end

  def destroy?
    valid_user?
  end

  def update?
    valid_user?
  end

end
```
