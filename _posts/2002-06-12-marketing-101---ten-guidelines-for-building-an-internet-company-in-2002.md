We've all thought about building Internet companies -- even in this post dot com collapse era.&nbsp; There is still real value in online businesses but it isn't the radical, world shaping thing that we thought it was from 95 - 2000.&nbsp; It's just business.&nbsp; Here are some guidelines for building an Internet company in 2002.

**NOTE:** I know that the title of this is 10.&nbsp; And the quantity is 12.&nbsp; Once again I got carried away.

1. **Treat People Well**.&nbsp; (Note -- I am [ex-Dot Commer](http://www.fuzzygroup.com/resume.htm) so I do have the right to say this).&nbsp; Dot coms were notorious for their ability to abuse their staff.&nbsp; I saw this first hand and it was just plain repulsive.&nbsp; When you build any business, Internet or not, you need to treat people well.&nbsp; This includes staff, customers, partners and suppliers.&nbsp; Oh... And did I treat my people well?&nbsp; Take a peek and see their [feedback](http://www.fuzzygroup.com/fanmail/#mascotscans) to me.  
  
2. **Physical Before Virtual**.&nbsp; While the speed with which a virtual company can move is just plain FAST, anything in the physical world takes real time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You need to build this into your schedules and recognize that as fast as you want to move -- the world may well not accommodate you.&nbsp; Figure in that you need to do the physical before the virtual.&nbsp; And take whatever amount of time you allocate for the physical?&nbsp; And increase it by 50%.&nbsp; We all underestimate.&nbsp; Each and every one of us.  
  
3. **Relationships take Time and Work**.&nbsp; If you have any illusions about succeeding with someone else's help like a partner or supplier, bear in mind that these things take time.&nbsp; This is particularly true when working with large firms and government agencies.&nbsp; It all takes time.&nbsp; And it takes work.&nbsp;   
  
4. **Partnerships Only Work if Both Parties Make Money**.&nbsp; A huge number of dot coms were based on the precept of the dot com reaping extraordinary margins on the backs of others.&nbsp; Yes this does work a few times (think ebay still, AOL selling ads during the height of the madness).&nbsp; But it's very, very rare.&nbsp; And this is the exception not the rule.&nbsp; In general if both parties aren't making $$$ then it just fails.  
  
5. **Create the Product Literature First**.&nbsp; A really, really useful technique, at least for myself, is to write the product literature in full before I start a project.&nbsp;   
  
6. Run the #s.&nbsp; Know the #s.&nbsp; No one else will know them and they will trust you even when they are wrong (but they sound right).&nbsp; Other Internet companies (and even most Venture Capitalists) are running so fast that they dont take the time to figure this stuff out.  
  
7. Do Real Market Research.&nbsp; What this means is talk to real live customers and ask what they think.&nbsp; Listen, write it down and communicate it to everyone else on the team  
  
8. **Be Honest**.&nbsp; d  
  
9. **Trust**.&nbsp;   
  
10. **Don't Raise Money**.&nbsp;   
  
11. **Run Cheap**.
