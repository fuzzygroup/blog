Despite my friend Sean Kennedy's best efforts, I'm still a damn command line git user but he has tried.  Old dogs / new tricks.  Two new tools for git (or new to me at least) are:

* [Sublime Merge](https://www.sublimemerge.com/)
* [Git Fork](https://git-fork.com/)

I know both of these are good but I just can't bring myself to use them.  Of the two I suspect I'd prefer Sublime Merge as Sublime Text is increasingly my backup editor when TextMate vomits its own brain and goes into a spasm of bullshite; sigh.
