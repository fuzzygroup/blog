This article was inspired by Carole, who emailed me out of the blue, and pointed out to me just how hard it is to launch a career when you just graduated -- and the economy basically stinks (at least for high technology).&nbsp; Thanks Carole.&nbsp; I hope this helps.&nbsp; So, here it goes, 10 recommendations for the new graduate.

## 12 Recommendations for the New CS Graduate

1. **Required Stuff.** &nbsp; Get the required stuff in order before you start the job hunt.&nbsp; If you are a technical person then you want to look like it.&nbsp; Here's what I see as a minimum: 
  - **Multi Format Resume**.&nbsp; You need a resume, regularly updated, in these formats: .DOC or .RTF, .PDF, .HTML, .TXT.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; People will ask you for it multiple ways and you want to be ready that minute, not fumbling around.&nbsp; Here's my own resume as [HTML](http://www.fuzzygroup.com/resume.htm).&nbsp; 
  - **Personal Web Site**.&nbsp; If you don't have one, why not?&nbsp; With even a site on your own domain name being available for hosting fees as low as $10, this is a cheap investment.&nbsp; Or, rather than a personal site, you could .... (see next) 
  - **Blog**.&nbsp; Start writing a blog about what you know (or want to know).&nbsp; Don't tell me that you just graduated and you don't know anything -- it that's true then why would I hire you?&nbsp; Here's an example -- take your senior thesis or project and then use your blog to expose it to the world.&nbsp; Or take it and translate it to a new language, illustrating the process.&nbsp; Did it in Java?&nbsp; Then do it again for Python.&nbsp; Just get yourself out there in a fashion that will appeal to someone that might hire you.&nbsp; And, see my Secrets of a High Volume Blogger essay.&nbsp; Don't think they work?&nbsp; See my rankings. 
  - **Postings to Mailing Lists / Discussion Groups**.&nbsp; If you come to me and pitch yourself as a Java programmer (or a Perl guy or whatever) then I'm probably going to just google your email address or home page and see what you've been doing.&nbsp; If I see that you haven't ever done anything online, I'll be curious as to why.&nbsp; Disclaimer: I've been hiring engineers since 1987 and did the obligatory VP of Engineering at a dot com.&nbsp; I did this for every single person I interviewed; didn't always bring it up, but I did do my homework and so will others.&nbsp; It doesn't take long to build up a track record with this kind of stuff -- just a few weeks on an active list like php-general can give you quite a rep.  
  
2. **Leverage Your Email Signature**.&nbsp; I advise that you include a link to the HTML version of your resume on every single email signature you send out.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Someone will check it out.&nbsp; They might forward it to&nbsp;someone else.&nbsp; Yes it's a long shot.&nbsp; So what?   
  
3. **Learn a Hot Technology**.&nbsp; With the millions of C programmers out there, C or even C++ will not differentiate you from the pack.&nbsp; You need to get a more marketable skill.&nbsp; This might be Python or Java or Jython or X.&nbsp; Watch the trends, look at sites like [www.ddj.com](http://www.ddj.com) and figure it out and then get some expertise in it.  
  
4. **Pitch In on an Open Source Project**.&nbsp; I am a huge believer in Open Source (OS).&nbsp; I personally think that CS departments across the globe should just adopt a project annually and contribute their resources to it.&nbsp; This would be a great way for OS projects to get more bodies, albeit not always the most experienced ones.&nbsp; Don't be afraid to pick something that interests you and then just start helping out.&nbsp; I've never seen an OS project that didn't need a tester or a documenter or a coder.&nbsp; The one advice I would give you though is: STICK WITH IT.&nbsp; The last thing any project needs is an on and off, in and out person.&nbsp; If you are going to do that then at least focus on clear deliverables and meet them.&nbsp; Example: "This week I will write a FAQ for X".&nbsp; Looking for a project to contribute to?&nbsp; See [www.freshmeat.net](http://www.freshmeat.net) or [www.sourceforge.net](http://www.sourceforge.net) or Google for TERM "open source".&nbsp;   
  
Obligatory Ad, Feel Free to Skip: Willing to pitch in on a cool web service, that's anti-microsoft, based on a distributed computing&nbsp;model, written in Python and PHP and uses the Jabber protocols?&nbsp; Look at [http://www.fuzzygroup.com/roffice/](http://www.fuzzygroup.com/roffice/).&nbsp; We're just getting started, have next to no code right now but two&nbsp;kind of bright senior guys (Me and George Thiruvathukal, CS professor from Loyola, author of at least one Python book, search [www.amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com) for his credentials).  
  
5. **Be Helpful**.&nbsp; If you have ever been in a dialog with me, you know that I'm not afraid to tell you if your Install stinks (I am polite though) or if your site is down or if you have a broken link.&nbsp; I believe that a) being helpful is important and b) that you can always talk to someone if you have the right opener.&nbsp; Helping out is a great opener.  
  
6. **Don't Look Only at Big Companies**.&nbsp; First mistake everyone makes is the "I want to work for Sun | Microsoft | IBM".&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp; Less than likely on a statistical basis just from the # of jobs available to # of candidates ratio.&nbsp; Also, realize that these companies tend to do a lot of resume screening by school.&nbsp; "Didn't go to MIT | Stanford | Carnegie Mellon ?&nbsp; Ha".&nbsp; Keep that in mind.&nbsp; I know it sucks, you know it sucks but it's a fact.&nbsp; There is one thing that might help you though: if you are part of an uncommon minority group in high technology.&nbsp; I hate to bring this up, and I&nbsp;REFUSE to get into a debate on it, but it is a fact.&nbsp; For example, IBM, for years, has prided itself on hiring certain groups of minorities.&nbsp; Like it or not, when you are starting out, play every card you have.  
  
  
There are lots and lots of little high tech companies out there.&nbsp; And, dollars to donuts, there is one in your home town.&nbsp; Look around, check the phone book, do the [www.google.com](http://www.google.com) research.&nbsp; Try searching for "High Tech" TOWN\_NAME or "Software" TOWN\_NAME or "Programming" TOWN\_NAME (omit the quotes).&nbsp; If you find one then call or email the owner.&nbsp; Ask if you can help out.&nbsp; Heck, ask if you can just do stuff for free to learn (last resort, if you have to, but don't think it's not worth trying).  
  
  
Here's another benefit to small companies: Cross Department Promotion.&nbsp; A lot of times people think that getting into Microsoft via QA or Support will get them a programming job.&nbsp; From what I've been told that isn't true.&nbsp; Small companies, at least the good ones,&nbsp;tend to be more flexible.  
  
7. **Freelance or Part Time Work Can Get You In the Door**.&nbsp; If you can't get a full time job then can you get a part time job.&nbsp; Every company needs a tester or a support person or something.&nbsp; Use any avenue you can to get in the door.  
  
8. **Learn the Required Skills**.&nbsp; There are certain basic software engineering skills that I think are just about required these days.&nbsp; And they rarely, if ever, teach them in school.&nbsp; If you don't know basic CVS / version control then you need to.&nbsp; If you don't understand Linux / Unix System Administration then you need to.&nbsp; If you don't understand regression testing the you need to.&nbsp; If you don't understand how to document an API then you need to.&nbsp; These things are basic, common and practical.&nbsp; And they weren't taught in school (and least not in 85 - 90, when I went to school).  
  
9. **Learn the Hot Methodology**.&nbsp; I am not a big fan of development methodologies.&nbsp; I've seen the patterns wave, the object wave, the structured programming wave, the UML wave, etc.&nbsp; These are all both good and bad.&nbsp; Still there is a benefit to knowing them just as a resume point.&nbsp; Right now it's XP or Extreme Programming and even I think it's damn good.&nbsp; [www.extremeprogramming.org](http://www.extremeprogramming.org)   
  
10. **Read Voraciously in the Field.&nbsp;** I don't care if it's books, magazines, web pages, etc.&nbsp; This is a knowledge based profession and the more you know, the better you will do.&nbsp; I read everything from stuff on managing programming staff to algorithms.&nbsp; You don't have to memorize it by any means -- the goal is to be aware of it's existence so that when you need it, you can reference it easily.  
  
11. **Program Every Single Day.&nbsp;** This is a field where the more you do it,&nbsp;the better you get.&nbsp; So you need to program every single day or your skills&nbsp;never get any better (actually&nbsp;they decline).&nbsp; Don't have something you want to write?&nbsp; See #4.&nbsp;   
  
  
2nd Obligatory Ad: Need a cool project in PHP related to blogs?&nbsp; Email me (I can always come up with something, I have a bigger todo list now than I ever have).  
  
12. **Ask People for Help**.&nbsp; Don't be afraid to speak up&nbsp;--&nbsp;look at Carole here.&nbsp; She bothered to ask and got an entire essay tailored to her situation.&nbsp;   
  
13. **Ask Friends and Family**.&nbsp; I just ran this essay by [Natrak](http://www.natrak.net/).&nbsp;&nbsp;And he pointed out that this is how he got his start.&nbsp; Great point.&nbsp; Thanks man!

Why 12 you ask?&nbsp; I just couldn't stop towards the end.&nbsp;
