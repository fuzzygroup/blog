Our house is largely powered by Amazon Alexa's devices.  I have even gone so far as to put them into our guest bedroom.  This blog post was written as something I put on the dresser for our first house guests using the room after I changed the lighting over to be Alexa powered.  Yep.  I've just written documentation for the guest room.  Deep Sigh.  On the positive side my house now has a very, very Star Trek feel to it.  This makes me happy.

For people who don't know what an Alexa is, an Alexa is a voice based computing platform that allows you to issue voice commands that can do lots and lots of different things like play music, turn on lights, supply a romantic or dimmed light mood instead of using candles, set timers, etc.  

The next section is examples of what you can do in *our* guest room with its Alexa.

## Alexa Example Commands

## Lighting 
* Alexa turn on guest room
 * Alexa turn on guest room lights
 * Alexa turn off guest room lights
* Alexa set guest room to Savanah Sunset
 * Alexa set guest room to arctic sunrise
 * Alexa turn on guest room
 * Alexa turn on savanah sunset 
 * Alexa set guest room to green
  * Alexa set guest room to red
## Music
 * Alexa play Journey
 * Alexa play Frank Sinatra
 * Alexa play Raise Your Glass by Pink
 * Alexa play Christmas carols
## Clock and Time
 * Alexa what time is it
* Alexa set a 10 minute timer
 * Alexa set a timer named check plex for new movies for 10 minutes
 * Alexa set a 7 am alarm
 * Alexa set an alarm for 7
 * Alexa set a 2 minute timer named brush my teeth
## General Life
 * Alexa what is 43 * 523 
## What Do I Wear 
* Alexa what is the weather
* Alexa what temperature is it?
## For Fun
* Alexa Play Akinator
 * Alexa tell me a joke
 * Alexa why did the chicken cross the road
 * Alexa Mordor thing shelley knows JSJ

And if you want to be kind of an funny jerk you can also say 
 * *Alexa turn off all lights* 

This will turn off all lights in the entire house.  Boom!  Now this seems like an insane feature until you realize that your kids have never found a light they wouldn't prefer to leave on.  Deeper sigh.

## More Details on Alexa

A single Alexa device costs about $50 and can replace your:

 * Alarm Clock
 * Radio
 * Weather Report
 * Stereo
 * Timer
 * Light Switch

I use the following equipment in our guest room:
 * An [Alexa Echo Dot Third Generation](https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Dot-3rd-Gen/dp/B0792K2BK6/). The new third generation, the one I actually linked to is a much better stereo replacement since the speaker was improved.  
 * [A Wall Mount](https://www.amazon.com/Compatible-Kitchens-Space-Saving-Solution-Management/dp/B07JX5DNX5)
 * 2 Phillips HUE Color Changing Light Bulbs; the [Starter Kit](https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Hue-Equivalent-Assistant-California/dp/B07DPYM57M/) is usually the best deal.

In terms of other smart home technologies, I've used X-10 and Iris and I am so, so, so much happier with Alexa.

## Privacy 

And, yes, I know the argument about not wanting Amazon to listen in on your home.  I don't believe that is a valid concern given that virtually every one reading this generally carries a cell phone that is already doing this (Hey Siri / Hello Google).  Scott McNealy pointed out the loss of our privacy back in the 90s.  This is not news.

*Disclaimer*: Oh hell yes I'm an Amazon shareholder.  I'm also a proud user of as many AWS APIs as I can find.  Go buy an Alexa.  Hell please buy six or seven.  I have at least six of them.
