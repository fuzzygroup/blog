<font size="+1"><b>Marketing 101: Where Silly Product Names Come From or Your Worst Nightmares Confirmed...</b></font>

[Note -- This memory crawled up into my conscious brain during   
this morning's shower.&nbsp; It's damn amusing.&nbsp; And it's 100% true.&nbsp; I was there.]

Most of my readers are technical folk.&nbsp; This article will, without question, tell them that their worst fears about marketing folk are, actually, true -- in about 90% of the cases (hey, I'm kind of a marketing person).&nbsp; Here's the situation:

1. In a board room far, far away, in a publicly traded company that's no longer in business, I sat in a 2 - 3 hour discussion of a new product and it's name. 
2. Present were: 
  - Me as an advisor 
  - CEO / Founder / Chairman 
  - VP of Marketing Services 
  - VP of Public Relations 
  - Product Manager 
  - Product Marketing Manager
3. The product in question was a highly sophisticated electronic publishing tool really for making&nbsp;CDs but with some features for Internet publishing and LAN publishing. 
4. Names ranged from the creative to the functional. 
  - A creative name for this might be "Zandar" or "MaxPub" i.e. a name without a real tie to what the product does.&nbsp; This type of name can ultimately build a stronger brand but is hard to establish. 
  - A functional name for this product might be "Electronic Publishing System" or "Insert\_Company\_Name\_Here Electronic Publishing System".&nbsp; Functional names are boring but clear for customers (and that's good).
5. After a long, long time the following situation and conversation occurred:

The CEO didn't really like any of the names.&nbsp; The VP of Public Relations said _"It's an electronic publishing system.&nbsp; Why don't we add Management to the name.&nbsp; That always makes things sound like they can sell for more money."_&nbsp; And, so, a new product name was born:

**EPMS  
  
Electronic Publishing Management System**

Two obvious problems:

1. The product didn't really have what our customers viewed as management features.&nbsp; In the context of the document world, "management" really means check in / check out / access control / accounting for documents.&nbsp; This product really had none of this.&nbsp; This forced our sales force into "spin doctor mode".&nbsp; And, if you've ever had an aggressive sales force, you know where this leads: Telling customers what they want to hear.&nbsp; Sales folk generally get their commissions when the sale is closed -- so they have an incentive to cheat the system (they can quit before the customer realizes what they bought). 
2. EPMS?&nbsp; Enhanced PMS?&nbsp; Anyone else out there get this?&nbsp; I thought it was funny as hell.
