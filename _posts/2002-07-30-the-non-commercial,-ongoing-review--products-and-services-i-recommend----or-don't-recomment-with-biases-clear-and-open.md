I don't know about anyone else out there but, with the current ethical shall we say faux pas's, that are all too common in the business and the media, I don't trust big organizations any more.&nbsp; Maybe I never really did but I find that when I see a review in PC Week or InfoWorld or Gartner or Aberdeen and then I see a big vendor ad right next to it (example - in this month's Blank (don't want to get harrassed by big media company, going to leave the name out, right after a columnist waxes poetic about a product, there is an ad for that product within 4 pages of it; coincidence), I say "I wonder ...".&nbsp; Here's what I do trust: Fellow Bloggers.&nbsp; Sure the product isn't evaluated along 15 criteria (and a grid!) but it's honest.&nbsp; Biases are open.&nbsp; Still, finding random blog entries about 1 product they might use isn't easy.&nbsp; So here's my solution: This Radio Story.

As I use a product or service, I'll document it's use from time to time from installation to throwing it out and let people know at least what I think of it.&nbsp; Sure I'm not a reviewer professionally but if your needs dovetail with mine this might be useful for you.&nbsp; Additionally I'll try and write about NON commercial products as well.&nbsp; I find that I use less and less commercial software every day and substitute in Open Source, Freeware, Shareware, etc.

And if other bloggers want to do the same type of thing, I'll link to you from the bottom of this article.
