<p>Noel, one of the sys admins here at <a href="http://feedster.com/">Feedster</a>, just let me know this:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you minimize Firefox, it will (automagically) <strong>reclaim memory</strong> that it's no longer using.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apparently this is a workaround for the <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174604">Firefox bug</a> where it doesn't reclaim memory for tabs that you've closed (a long time FireFox / Mozilla bug I've blogged about in the past). Now when Noel told me this, I immediately tried it and saw my memory usage go from 153 megs* to 52 megs. Awesome. Thanks Noel. (Oh and this works in Thunderbird also so I strongly recommend minimizing your Firefox and Thunderbird windows every few hours).  </p>
<p>* Yes I'm a Tabaholic.  I'm currently searching for a support group on this.  Please contact me if you have suggestions.</p>

<p align="left">(That's like 25 tabs in one browser window and 5 browser windows open total; I do have issues) </p>
