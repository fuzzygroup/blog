<font size="+1"><b>Consulting 101: So You Want to Hire a Consultant, Do You?</b></font>

This document is the inverse of the normal Consulting 101 document.&nbsp; This document looks at hiring a consultant from the perspective of what the client should ask (or do) before bringing the consultant on.&nbsp;

And, yes, by posting this, please feel free to ask me these questions if you should hire me.  
  
After All: It's only fair I used to ask them when I hired consultants.

**NOTE:** The assumption here is that you are hiring some type of web / Internet consultant but the questions are mostly applicable to any type of consultant.

1. Is your production server under your desk?&nbsp; Can you reach out and kick it?&nbsp; Hosting on a cable modem or DSL line just isn't reliable or acceptable.&nbsp; 
2. Have you specifically done X before?&nbsp; Fill in X with a highly specific example.&nbsp; 
  - NO: Have you programmed in Java before? 
  - YES: Have you used Java to build network monitoring applications?
3. Can I see your coding standards?&nbsp; Everyone has these and should, pretty much be able to produce them on demand.&nbsp; Yes, I do too.&nbsp; Here they are: [http://www.fuzzygroup.com/codingstandards.htm](http://www.fuzzygroup.com/codingstandards.htm)
4. How do they backup?&nbsp; How often do they backup?&nbsp; (Why?&nbsp; If your consultant goes down then you're in trouble). 
5. Do they backup mail, etc or just data files? (Why?&nbsp; If they lose their mail file then you, the client, will be resending them a lot of old messages).
6. How do they track bugs? 
7. How are you billed for: 
  1. Phone Calls? 
  2. Email Messages? 
  3. Instant Messages?
8. Do you have access to in process work such as specifications, proposals, etc?&nbsp; My clients do, here's what they can access:

  - [Screen Shot 2](http://radio.weblogs.com/0103807/images/client_management_2.gif). 
  - [Screen Shot 3](http://radio.weblogs.com/0103807/images/client_management_3.gif). 
  - [Screen Shot 4](http://radio.weblogs.com/0103807/images/client_management_4.gif).
9. How do you protect the security of the work that you do for me?
10. Can I see some code you've written?&nbsp; Here's the key to making this work -- even if you don't understand the code, you should a) not give them time to prepare -- since then what's the point, you want to see normal engineering practices, not prettified stuff and b) just look and see if it's neat and if there are comments.&nbsp; This gives you a pretty good feel for the person's engineering practices.
11. References?&nbsp; I tend to put less faith in this then a lot of people since I assume that any consultant you want to hire is smart enough to NOT give out references to customers that are unhappy.
