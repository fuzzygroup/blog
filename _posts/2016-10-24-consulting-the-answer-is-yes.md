This happened a year or two ago but the memory just descended on me in a flash of blinding deja vu that was so powerful it was frightening.  If you're a consultant and a customer calls you with a problem, there's only one answer:

**Yes**

I remember this vividly.  I was in the final stages of a project -- I had just assembled the staging server and I was looking forward to the end of the night and sleep, blessed sleep.  I heard from the customer who was clearly panicked.  His vendor was holding him up on a data migration issue and was charging an arm and a leg and then three more body parts for something simple -- $25K for migrating 60 users from staging to production.  I'm not going to say the vendor since they're long gone.  I would point out that the charge for the migration was more than my whole software development bill to that point.  

So my answer to the question of could I handle the data migration -- **Yes**.  When I said it, I didn't know anything about the data I was migrating.  I didn't have a schema, properties, etc.  What I did know was that $25K for doing data migration was absurd and, as a consultant, I'm there to help the client.  Always remember that -- you're there to help the client.  So even though I didn't want more work, I'll still do it and, ultimately, the client will remember who helped them out in a point of crisis.  

Bottom line -- if you're a consultant, the answer is **yes**.
