I just ran into one of those perplexing predicaments.&nbsp; After being exiled from my house to Starbucks for a house showing (that sale I mentioned recently?&nbsp; fell thru; sigh) and doing a bunch of work while being professionally caffeinated, I wanted to upload what I did.&nbsp; So I booted up my Linux laptop and all was goodness until I tried to scp (secure copy) stuff to my server and got nothing.&nbsp; Huh?&nbsp; What?.&nbsp; Tried my faithful network girlfriend, ping, and got this disturbing error message:

**connect: network is unreachable**

I twiddled around for a bit and did

### Original IM Transcript:

DemitriousK: whats the q?  
fuzzygroup: on phone.&nbsp; are you around for a bit ?  
DemitriousK: dunno  
DemitriousK: try in a bit :-)  
fuzzygroup: pcmcia network card stopped working totally.&nbsp; 2nd one has same symptoms.  
DemitriousK: eww  
DemitriousK: symptoms?  
fuzzygroup: sec  
fuzzygroup: restarting  
fuzzygroup: dumped mock gf phone call  
DemitriousK: umm... i dont know if thats good or bad?  
fuzzygroup: getting a working network card is more important  
DemitriousK: :-)  
fuzzygroup: the link light does not light up  
fuzzygroup: and a ping gives "connect: network is unreachable"  
fuzzygroup: i tried another linksys card (diff model but I think drivers are the same) and had the same symptoms  
fuzzygroup: I can order another exactly the same but thought some trouble shooting was called for before the $119 was spent  
DemitriousK: wifi?  
fuzzygroup: nope  
fuzzygroup: just wired  
fuzzygroup: and i confirmed that the cable is live  
DemitriousK: try a diff net cable?  
DemitriousK: o  
DemitriousK: hmm  
fuzzygroup: lol.  
fuzzygroup: where would error logs be to start ?  
DemitriousK: /var/log/  
DemitriousK: probably messages  
DemitriousK: type 'dmesg'  
DemitriousK: and check the end of the output  
fuzzygroup: all looks good  
fuzzygroup: can't paste it to you. sigh.  
fuzzygroup: wait   
fuzzygroup: ah ha  
fuzzygroup: "timed out waiting for a valid dhcp server message"  
fuzzygroup: how do I manually bind an ip address ?  
fuzzygroup: ifconfig   
DemitriousK: ifconfig eth0 up \<ip\>  
DemitriousK: route add -net default gw \<gateway\>  
DemitriousK: and add 'nameserver \<name server ip address\>' to /etc/hosts  
DemitriousK: nameserver 66.122.168.68 works   
fuzzygroup: mission control we have ping.&nbsp; repeat.&nbsp; we have ping.  
DemitriousK: :-)  
DemitriousK: i got a dollar. i got a dollar. i got a dollar hey hey hey hey  
DemitriousK: !!!  
fuzzygroup: getting a problem on the route command though  
fuzzygroup: lol.  
fuzzygroup: I typed  
fuzzygroup: nvr mind  
fuzzygroup: and we have dns  
fuzzygroup: :-)   
fuzzygroup: my laptop says thank you.  
fuzzygroup: may ability to upload the work I did at starbucks says thank you.  
fuzzygroup: I bet I need to restart my router / gateway.  
fuzzygroup: Sigh.  
fuzzygroup: thanks man!  
fuzzygroup: I'll write that up and cross link it to your site.  
fuzzygroup: useful to have on hand for the next time.  
DemitriousK: hehe  
DemitriousK: :-)  
DemitriousK: yea ive been in that predicimate before :-)  
fuzzygroup: "When the DHCP don't DHCP"
