**NOTE**: I'm not telling you to do this.  This blog post advocates bulk permission changing and that's risky but HomeBrew was entirely broken and brew doctor did not work.  And this solution did.  Use at your own risk.

I have two primary machines -- a Mac Desktop and a dual monitor Mac Laptop.  I use the laptop more mostly from habit but I'd really like to use the desktop for something that makes me feel better about it being next to me and yet rarely used.  One of the reasons for two machines is one is my daily driver and one is experimental.  For example, my desktop I installed NuShell on recently as I didn't (yet) trust it enough.  

I recently discovered that HomeBrew wouldn't install things correctly on my desktop.  The issue was always permissions issues and when I dug into it, I found that 

    /usr/local/Cellar

was owned by, well, NOT me.  The answer, as with so many other *nix things is chown (DO NOT DO THE FOLLOWING):

    sudo chown -R sjohnson:wheel /usr/local/Cellar

-or- that's what I thought the answer was.  Unfortunately while a:

    brew install boost
    
worked seemingly nicely, it failed at the final step:

This had me look on my good machine at the overall /usr/local directory:

and this led me to the following series of commands:

    sudo chown -R sjohnson:admin /usr/local/Caskroom
    sudo chown -R sjohnson:admin /usr/local/Cellar
    sudo chown -R sjohnson:admin /usr/local/Frameworks
    sudo chown -R sjohnson:admin /usr/local/Homebrew
    sudo chown -R sjohnson:admin /usr/local/bin
    sudo chown -R sjohnson:admin /usr/local/etc
    sudo chown -R sjohnson:admin /usr/local/include
    sudo chown -R sjohnson:admin /usr/local/lib
    sudo chown -R sjohnson:admin /usr/local/opt
    sudo chown -R root:wheel /usr/local/remotedesktop
    sudo chown -R sjohnson:admin /usr/local/sbin
    sudo chown -R sjohnson:admin /usr/local/share
    sudo chown -R sjohnson:admin /usr/local/var

Although I normally wouldn't advocate this much bulk permission fuckery, it did actually work and a brew install boost worked just fine after it.
