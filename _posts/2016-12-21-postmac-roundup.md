Here are a few more things in the ongoing PostMac roundup:

* [Apple’s Tim Cook assures employees that it is committed to the Mac and that ‘great desktops’ are coming](https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/19/apples-tim-cook-assures-employees-that-it-is-committed-to-the-mac-and-that-great-desktops-are-coming/) | [HN Discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13217008)  Given that Tim Cook is the one who said publicly that people should use iPads and not laptops I'd have to wonder about this.  [Gruber on This Comment](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/10/31/cook-why-would-you-buy-a-pc-anymore).  Lots of good comments on people using Linux in place of OSX here.  [A brilliant comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13217412).
