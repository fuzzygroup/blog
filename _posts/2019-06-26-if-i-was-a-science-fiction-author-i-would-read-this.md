I'm not a science fiction writer.  Nor do I even play one on the Internet but I do know people who are.  Here are two fantastic books that I suspect could easy provide the "science" in your "science fiction":

* [How To](https://www.amazon.com/How-Absurd-Scientific-Real-World-Problems/dp/0525537090/ref=sr_1_1?crid=UQX5KJ82O5ML&keywords=randall+munroe&qid=1561645604&s=books&sprefix=randall+munr%2Caps%2C279&sr=1-1)
* [Thing Explainer](https://www.amazon.com/Thing-Explainer-Complicated-Stuff-Simple/dp/0544668251/ref=sr_1_2?crid=UQX5KJ82O5ML&keywords=randall+munroe&qid=1561645604&s=books&sprefix=randall+munr%2Caps%2C279&sr=1-2)
* [What If](https://www.amazon.com/What-If-Scientific-Hypothetical-Questions/dp/0544272994/ref=sr_1_3?crid=UQX5KJ82O5ML&keywords=randall+munroe&qid=1561645604&s=books&sprefix=randall+munr%2Caps%2C279&sr=1-3)

**Note**: How To isn't out yet.  

All of these books are by Randall Munroe of XKCD fame.  What a lot of people don't know is that Randall graduated from MIT and his science is what you'd expect from someone who pulled off graduating from MIT -- **excellent**.
