tags: ["meetup", "elixir"]

* Background: 10 years doing ruby / 9 years doing rails; I tired of crap performance and unreliability; mostly a consultant

* Six months of mucking with elixir so I sent myself to elixirconf to force myself to get started

* Overview: Its real

* People are actually using it
  
* I expected Rails 1 and got Rails 3 (level of finish)

* Deploy is still hard (expected)

* Great training class - sonny scrogson highly recommended

* Big changes coming to phoenix 

* Personality - "Get Off My Beam" erlang folks versus "Beam for Millenials"

* Talented, smart, helpful, nice community

* Big emphasis on documentation -- replaces the rails focus on TDD

* Hex.pm is immature
  * Use erlang libraries versus 0.1x elixir
  
* DRY is no longer the motto

* Surprising thing for me was boyd multerer
  * nerves - 16 K for a full fault tolerant embedded stack
  * former architect of xbox live
  * could have chosen anything he wanted
