Given my recent [tweet](https://twitter.com/fuzzygroup/status/791907801824043009) about my absolute dissatisfaction with Apple's new MacBook Pros, specifically the fact that storage and memory are on part with my **Mid 2012 MacBook Pro**, its time to consider options.  I'm partially down the road of a Hackintosh although my build got stalled out and I have a pile of non working pieces waiting for me to get back to them.  But in the event that doesn't work out I need a backup plan.

Here's what I'm looking for in a configuration:

* 64 gigs of ram
* minimum of 1 TB ssd
* traditional USB; USB 3 sounds great but the issues have me concerned
* ethernet
* able to drive a Dell Ultra Wide Screen Display
* wifi
* fanless; I'm so absolutely tired of my MacBook Air sounding like a small propeller every time Safari fires up

Oddly this doesn't have to be a laptop.  DropBox is so bloody good that I can have a lesser box for when I travel since sync is now a non issue.  As long as all my files are present, I'm far more machine independent than I used to be.  If I pull my development into Docker that would very much isolate me from cross machine differences -- at least theoretically

I find the [Intel Skull Canyon NUC](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/nuc/nuc-kit-nuc6i7kyk-features-configurations.html) interestingly compelling and I really have no idea why -- maybe it is the skull.

In terms of the OS I suspect its either a Hackintosh version of Capitan or Elementary OS.  I'm wondering seriously about moving to Linux for development and OSX just for things I can't readily move over like photos / media.

I've started tracking links on the post mac world on my [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:fuzzygroup/t:postmac/).

This is utter madness -- if you had told me even 2 years ago that Apple would release new Macbook Pros and I would be thinking about leaving the platform in disgust, I wouldn't have believed it.  Sigh.
