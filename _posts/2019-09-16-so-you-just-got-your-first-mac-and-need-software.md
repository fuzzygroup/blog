## Great Software

A good friend just go their first work Mac and I thought that it might be kind of me to write down tools that I use, some obvious, some less so.  Here's the way to understand this, this list is ordered by what I use the most at the top and descends from there.  And if I took the time to actually describe it then I really care about it as a tool.

**Note**: See the section below about Don't Install Software Manually before you start following links.

* [TextMate](https://macromates.com/) - I have been using this editor since its first release - and it is now more than a decade later and I still love it.
* [iTerm, iTerm, iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/) - I live in iTerm.
* [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/) - Run, don't walk and get yourself HomeBrew.  Think of it as apt-get for OSX and, well, that's what it is.  Absolutely recommended.
* [NetNewsWire](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/) - If you aren't using a news aggregator then you should be.
* [MailPlane](https://mailplaneapp.com/) - this is a custom client app for Gmail and while I don't use it religiously, the ability to have both a custom client you can always command + tab to as well as N browser windows for email is really powerful.
* [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) - natural language parsing that creates calendar events is wonderful.  
* [Enpass](https://www.enpass.io/) - the only password manager / digital wallet that has ever stuck for me.  I have no idea about its encryption / security but I can attest that it is damn usable.
* [Goofy](https://www.goofyapp.com/) - a quite good Facebook Messenger IM client
* [Acorn](https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/) - an excellent image editor from my favorite named [Mac Company](https://flyingmeat.com/) of all time
* [Transmit](https://panic.com/transmit/) - the best FTP and S3 client that exists
* [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/) - I'm not a Postgres guy really but I sometimes play one when MySQL isn't right for a project and when I do, well, I use Postico
* [Magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/) - Cool window manager
* [TinderBox](https://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/) - If you do serious intellectual work and deal with note taking then TinderBox is your tool.  It is expensive, powerful and awesome.
* [Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com/mac/)
* [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - If I wasn't so firmly in the TextMate camp then I'd use this.
* [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview)
* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
* [Sublime Merge](https://www.sublimemerge.com/)
* [Fork](https://fork.dev/)
* [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [ScreenFlow](https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/) - I don't screencast all that often but when I do, I use ScreenFlow.
* Pages / Numbers / Keynote - these are the standard Apple apps and they are generally good.
* DropBox - kind of required but good lord does it suck as a tool.  WTF DropBox (today DropBox took 96% of my cpu and tried to sync 600K files)
* VLC

## Don't Install Software Manually

The other thing that I would strongly recommend is that your Mac can be easily provisioned using Ansible and I made my Ansible provisioning routine open source years ago.  It can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/fuzzygroup/ansible-macbook-pro).  I haven't set up a Mac from scratch now in years and automated provisioning on your own machine is wonderful - please note that you may have issues with this since it has been years since I've gotten a new Mac and I only update this when I need it.
