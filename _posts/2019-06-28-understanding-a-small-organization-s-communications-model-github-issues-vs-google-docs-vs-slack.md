It is not hyperbole to say that communications is the lifeblood of an organization, even a small organization.  And while there are many types of communications tools that you use in an organization, I find that there are three common types:

* Ticket Tools aka Github Issues or Jira or Trello
* Documentation Tools such as Google Docs or Microsoft Word
* Realtime Tools such as Slack or Gitter or Discord

The obvious question becomes when to use what tool.  

# Ticketing Tools

A ticketing tool like Github Issues, Jira or Trello is really a communications message that amounts to "Do this Task".  Most good ticketing tools allow you to communicate in a bunch of ways including:

* Do this task (the ticket itself)
* Clarify it by attaching information to the ticket
* Engage in back and forth with people via discussion on the ticket

Think of your tickets as an on going communications forum that is *task oriented* and results in a deliverable.

# Documentation Tools

Back in the old days the only real communications tool was Microsoft Word and a Word document was the be all, end all.  Increasingly it now seems like a full writing environment like Word or Google Docs is what you use when you have to work something out conceptually.  

# Realtime Tools 

Both Slack and Discord are realtime discussion tools.  And what these tools do is give a way for 2 or more people to work out a problem and come to a consensus.  Slack discussions can transpire either synchronously or asynchronously and are a rich medium including attachments, polls, gifs, etc.  

# And There's a Flow

I wrote this originally because someone was asking me "what tool do I use" and I actually had problems parsing that statement.  To me this is a flow as much as anything.  I find that things might start in Slack, proceed into Google Docs and then into 1 or more Github Issues.  Alternatively you often see a Google Doc split into a half dozen Github Issues.

At least from an engineering perspective, the output of all of these communications tools is one or more tickets that represent a unit of work to be done.
