My buddy [Nick Janetakis](https://nickjanetakis.com/), a solid guy, Docker Captain and [Udemy course author](https://www.udemy.com/user/nick-janetakis/), wrote an interesting thing on his blog: [The Tools I Use](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/the-tools-i-use).  So I thought I'd take a shot at authoring the same thing only from an OSX perspective.  I am going to shamelessly steal his organization and approach to this topic.  

# OS 

Much to my regret my principal OS is Mac OSX Seira.  I've seen Apple's OS stability go down release by release from Snow Leopard forward and I find Seira to be the absolute worst yet.  Yes I'm a developer and my usage of iTerm is intense but a Unix box (and that's what all Mac's actually are) having an update of less than 30 days is disturbing at best.  Right now I have an 11 day uptime but lately I've been averaging about 2 days before my 6 month old box forcibly restarts all on its own.  Stack traces available on request if you care.

# Code Editor and Terminal

I use TextMate 2, a damn near antiquated editor by today's standards and I have a real love / hate relationship with it but I've written more code in than anything else except for VIM and it works fine for my needs.  A new editor would be wise but nothing feels as good as TextMate to me.

I use iTerm as a terminal and I regularly run an absolutely disturbing about of terminal sessions managed by Tmux which remains a stellar bit of technology.  Kudos to [Dv](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dvsuresh/) for hooking me on Tmux back in 2015; it genuinely improved my life.

# Notable Apps

Other than a text editor, terminal and Tmux, I use pretty little software but here goes:

* Chrome or Firefox for a browser with Brave on the side
* Activity Monitor at all times to shut down rogue Firefox sessions due to memory bloat
* Pages and Numbers for classical productivity although I do less and less of that every year
* Docker for containers
* [Transmit by Panic](https://panic.com/transmit/) as an FTP / S3 client
* [Fantastical 2](https://flexibits.com/fantastical)
* ngrok for http connection sharing (if you've never used ngrok and you're a developer, run, not walk and get it -- it is that good)
* Apple Mail for mail
* Slack because, well, Slack
* Skype (which gets worse and worse ever year it seems)
* TweetBot
* Wunderlist
* [Acorn](http://fuzzyblog.io/blog/software_worth_purchasing/2016/09/11/software-worth-purchasing-01-acorn.html)
* [Keypad Layout 2](https://github.com/janten/keypad-layout) for command key drive window resizing; yes I have the keyboard grid taped to my mac, it is that useful
* [Alfred 3](https://www.alfredapp.com/)
* [Enpass](http://fuzzyblog.io/blog/software_worth_purchasing/2016/09/15/software-worth-purchasing-02-enpass.html) as a digital wallet
* [Dropbox](http://fuzzyblog.io/blog/dropbox/2017/03/13/dropbox-for-the-software-developer.html) without which I simply could not function
* [Deckset](https://www.decksetapp.com/) for converting Markdown files to simple presentations
* Jekyll for blogging; so much of everything I do comes from Open Source but I wanted to call out Jekyll because, well, I'm using it right this second

# Computer, Desk and Phone

Here are the physical things I use:

* I run almost exclusively on a series of Mac laptops:
  * An old 15" Macbook Pro which runs the family media server
  * A Macbook Air which is my blogging / writing / backup dev box
  * A 15" Macbook Pro which is my secondary backup dev box but too slow for anything intensive
  * A 13" Macbook Pro, last generation, maxed out on ram and SSD to be as fast as possible (note to Apple - we need vastly more than 16 gigs)
  * I also have an Intel NUC as a Linux box but I don't use it all that much
  * All my Macs are configured with [Ansible](http://fuzzyblog.io/blog/osx/2016/11/20/ansible-for-configuring-your-mac-so-much-better.html)
* Apple iPhone 6; I didn't find the iPhone 7 improvements in the small form factor (non plus) to be enough to justify the upgrade and now I'm hoping it lasts thru the iPhone 8 launch
* I built my own desk ([pic 1](http://fuzzyblog.io/blog/assets/desk1.jpg), [pic 2](http://fuzzyblog.io/blog/assets/desk2.jpg), [pic 3](http://fuzzyblog.io/blog/assets/desk3.jpg)) about 18 months ago and I love it.  I have an 8 foot long desk with plenty of space.
* I use iPads to monitor long running jobs using Transmit's late StatusBoard app.  Pity that went away.
  
# Recording and Music

I don't do a lot of this but what I do use is:

* ScreenFlow for recording screencasts
* iTunes for music
* Audacity for audio editing on the rare occasion when I need that 
* Bose Quiet Comfort Headphones Wired for pair programming
* Bost Quiet Comfort Headphones BlueTooth for listening to music and isolating out the world in coffee shops
