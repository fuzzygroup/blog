I've now owned a few different homes over the years but my current home is the first one with a bathroom that is below ground level (in a finished basement).  When you have a bathroom below ground level then your plumbing subsystem has to have a "lift pump".  A lift pump system consists of:

* A sump in the floor where sewage (water / the other stuff) collects
* A pump that lifts the sewage up to the ground level where it can flow into the street level outflow

**Note**: A lift pump has a duty cycle of 8 to 10 years.  A lift pump has a replacement price of approximately $1,500 so these things are expensive.

## Things You Can't Flush with a Lift Pump

You can't flush:

* Kitty Litter
* Flushable Wipes

## How to Know When You Have a Problem with your Lift Pump

Here are three symptoms of failure:

* **Smell**.  A bad lift pump reveals itself with a fairly rank odor in the lower region of the house centered around the machinery room where the lift pump is located.
* **Leakage**.  Leakage from the sealed sump where the lift pump is located.
* **Noise**.  Many lift pump systems will have an alarm on them that beeps when there is an issue.

## Two Ways to Fix a Difficult Lift Pump

There are at least two failure symptoms with a lift pump:

* Pump doesn't work at all (no noise when you power cycle it)
* Pump works but you can't flush a toilet / have water backup / sump leakage

Here are two approaches to fixing the second:

* Turn it off and let it sit for a number of days.  Just as a clogged toilet will magically "fix" itself when left alone, so too will a lift pump that is clogged.  The blockage often dissolves.
* Lift the Vertical Pipe up and down and "shake" it.  The lift pump itself is directly coupled to the vertical pipe and if you lift it up and down / shaking it, you can often dislodge the blockage.

## Thank You

I learned all of this from David, a technician at Benjamin Franklin Plumbing who serviced my house today.  The $49 for the service call for him to tell me this much was much, much preferable to the $1500 fee for a new lift pump.
