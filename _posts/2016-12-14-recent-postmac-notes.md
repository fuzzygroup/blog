[Hacker News search on recent MacBook articles](https://hn.algolia.com/?query=macbook%20pro&sort=byPopularity&prefix&page=0&dateRange=pastWeek&type=story).

I should note that I am basically happy with my MacBook Pro 13" but I bought the previous generation so it is much, much older than the current.  And my wife absolutely adores here brand new MacBook (but not the pro).  Her only real objection is having to use a dongle to print on our old Brother laser printer but she's back in graduate school now and very, very happy with the weight and size of it.
