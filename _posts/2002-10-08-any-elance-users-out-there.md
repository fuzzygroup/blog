<p>At the FuzzyGroup we do web design and are always looking for new projects.&nbsp; I was wondering if anyone out there has had luck getting work through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013031121/http://www.elance.com/">Elance</a>.&nbsp; Elance is a site where you can post work to be bid on by service companies.&nbsp; It now requires you to pay between $150-$500 per quarter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013031121/https://secure.elance.com/c/reg/main/regsub.pl?pref=seller&amp;">[ GO ]</a>.&nbsp; Anyone have any input on this one?</p>
