Consulting 101: How Do I Market Myself as a New Consultant

This article is in response to an email from a reader.&nbsp; Here's the question:

> I have been working towards establishing my own Consulting Business for some time now and have done several contracts over the past few years.&nbsp; I would like to focus on consulting and up to this point have not really found the best way to market myself.
> 
> The area I would like to target is Manufacturing/Industrial Engineering in the automotive industry. I have made some contacts but the contracts I have landed have been through "headhunters" and I know there are choice contracts out there but I am not going to find them through a third party search pattern.&nbsp; I prefer to take control of my own options.
> 
> ...
> 
> I hesitate "jumping the gun" and losing potential contracts because of a bad approach -&nbsp; first impressions are never recaptured and difficult to change.&nbsp; Also this industry is very tight, word gets around quickly.&nbsp; I have to overcome the fact that I am a woman trying to make it in a man's industry without the added hinderance of a  
> bad first impression...
> 
> ...
> 
> Is it better to approach "face-to-face" or "cold calls" ?&nbsp; Personally I prefer "face-to-face".&nbsp; Is e-mail preferred?

And, here's the answer:

Marketing yourself is always the hardest part of consulting.&nbsp; It's always easy to do the work but it's hard to get it.&nbsp; Let's start with the basics -- by defining marketing and sales.

### What is Marketing?

Everyone has a different definition but this is the one I like:

> Marketing is the creation of demand for a product or service.
### What is Sales?

As with marketing, people define sales differently but here's what I like:

> Sales is the execution of strategies to fulfill demand for a product or service.
### Applying these Definitions

In terms of getting a small consulting business, I would recommend the following marketing steps to create demand for your services.

#### Marketing

- **Blog**.&nbsp; Showcase your knowledge with a website or blog (my preference).&nbsp; Given that this is how you found my article, it's a pretty good example, isn't it?&nbsp; Blogs are drop dead easy to create (and I do offer services if you need them but you probably don't) and I will plug [Essential Blogging](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596003889/qid=1032180590/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/002-4202734-9602408?v=glance&s=books&n=507846#product-details) here, a book that I co-wrote (huge bias obviously).&nbsp; Building a blog is an ongoing, daily effort but it pays off in spades.  
  
- **Answer Questions**.&nbsp; Find the vertical market website where questions&nbsp;about your domain of expertise are asked and start answering as many as possible.&nbsp; Put a signature line on every posting so people know who you are and how to find you and that you are available for work.&nbsp; Example:

[scott@fuzzygroup.net](mailto:scott@fuzzygroup.net)  
==================================  
  
- **Speak**.&nbsp; Try and get speaking engagements as much as possible.&nbsp; Often all you need to do is ask.&nbsp; Sometimes you'll even get paid (much to my surprise, I was paid for a recent talk I gave; I honestly had no idea that I'd get paid).  
  
- **Write**.&nbsp; If you aren't a strong writer then I'd encourage you to work on it.&nbsp; Writing is a key marketing tool for any consulting -- no matter what you do.&nbsp; Try and write articles for the trade publications that cover your field.&nbsp; Trade magazines always need content but you do need to ask them about it.&nbsp; I've even written books about the fields I'm interested in.  
  
- **Teach**.&nbsp; Here's something most consultants don't do -- teach.&nbsp; Is there a local school that teaches what you do?&nbsp; Can you offer a course in it?&nbsp; This might not directly bring in work but it goes a long way to making you look credible.  
  
- **Network**.&nbsp; Very few of us like to do it but it is a requirement.&nbsp; If there is an industry association for your field then join it.&nbsp; If there is a conference going on then go to it.&nbsp; If there is a bar where employers might frequent then drink there.&nbsp; Always, always, always have both business cards with the correct contact info and a brochure about your services with you.  
  
- **Persistence**.&nbsp; As with sales, marketing is a ongoing, continuous thing.&nbsp; You need to do it daily since it takes a long time for any marketing message to sink in.&nbsp; 

#### Sales

- **Email**.&nbsp; Answer every single email you get and do it quickly.&nbsp; Leads come in regularly once you start these activities and you can lose work as easily as you can get it   
(note -- lately I've been guilty of messing this up myself; but I'm getting better at it)  
  
- **Honesty**.&nbsp; Be honest and no BS.&nbsp; People don't want it anymore and don't worry so much about being a slick sales person -- we've all had our fill of those.&nbsp; If you don't know the answer say so -- but get back to them with it.  
  
- **Be Persistent**.&nbsp; These things take time.&nbsp; Here's an example.&nbsp; Back in April of 2002 I got an email over the transom from a potential lead in Luxembourg of all places.&nbsp; He told me then that he'd be ready to start work in 2 weeks.&nbsp; I did the quotation and proposal dance and then it was postponed.&nbsp; And postponed.&nbsp; And postponed.&nbsp; But all through the process I'd periodically contact him and maintain the relationship.&nbsp; As of my last email a few days ago, it may be a go in the next two weeks.&nbsp;   
  
- **First Impressions**.&nbsp; First impressions are hugely important as you note but you can almost always take the approach of "Bear with me, I'm new at this ..." and a bit of self deprecating humor goes a long way.&nbsp; Everyone likes to help people when its easy for them to do so -- since it makes them feel both good and powerful.&nbsp; Understanding this little bit of psychology can go a long way.  
  
- **Being Female.&nbsp;** Since you are female then, while that's a disadvantage (and good for you!!!&nbsp; it's tough to be a female engineer) then ask yourself " **Can my being female in a male dominated profession become an advantage?**"&nbsp; Are there any female owned firms in this industry that you could get in more easily?&nbsp; Does it help you to get  
govt work?&nbsp; And, just as a tip, like most men, I'm much more likely to read an email from a female name than a male name (so change your email sig to Patricia not Pat).&nbsp; I'll also take a phone call or meeting with you more easily.&nbsp; And, if that makes me a pig, so be it.&nbsp; At least I am an honest pig.&nbsp; Bear in mind that professional sales companies know this and have been using it for years.&nbsp; An example is RR Donnelly's Yellow Pages advertising sales division which is largely female.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Most small business owners are male and they can get in the door more easily.  
  
- **Face to Face.&nbsp;** I'm a huge advocate of face to face whenever possible.&nbsp; It's always, always good to look people in the eye and shake their hand.  
  
- **Getting in the Door.&nbsp;** Email is a good way to get in the door at times since it eliminates secretary like gatekeepers.
