URI.parse is a Ruby call I've written a thousand plus times.  The unfortunate reality of URI.parse is that it doesn't work when there are UTF-8 characters in the url.  The work around is the addressable gem.  So:

## Gemfile

    gem "addressable"

## Example Usage 

    require 'addressable/uri'
    url = 'http://www.example.com/wp content/uploads/2012/01/MÃ¼nchen.jpg'
    parts = Addressable::URI.parse(url)

## Shoutout

I can't even think about URL parsing in Ruby / Elixir / JavaScript without mentioning [Gamache's FuzzyUrl library](https://github.com/gamache/fuzzyurl.rb).  Highly, highly recommenderd.
