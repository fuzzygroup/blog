I don't normally just blog links to stuff but this is actually pretty good.  It is a well written set of questions to ask during a job interview.  And there's a Hacker News discussion which also surfaces more than a few things:

* [Job Interview Questions](https://github.com/viraptor/reverse-interview)
* [Hacker News Discussion of Job Interview Questions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20916749)

My two favorites are:

* Are you profitable?
* If not, how long is your runway?

If you are considering working for a startup and you don't ask about their runway (i.e. how long can they operate before needing to raise the next round), well, you're a damn fool.  And I include myself in that assertion -- because I haven't always asked that myself.

The author also recommends an oldie but a goodie, [The Joel Test](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/).
