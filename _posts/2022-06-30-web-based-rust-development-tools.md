I am not, alas, a compiled languages guy.  I do find Rust absolutely fascinating because by inverting the common assumptions, a whole class of software errors are being avoided.  Given that we live in a constant shite show of software quality, any engineering practices that generate better code are **highly desirable**.  Discovering testing and pair programming for me was I suspect as life changing as Rust feels to a C programmer.

Even though I don't really do compiled stuff, I do admit to being more than a bit of a language wonk -- if it is weird, interpreted and has a repl or is a stream process, well, that I'm good at.  My tools have included Ruby, Elixir, Python, JavaScript, PHP, Perl, Prolog (both Borland and Quintus on Sun 2), , Perl, VB, Awk, HyperAwk, Elm, OmniMark and others. So learning a bit about Rust feels pretty normal to me.

But I digress -- this is about Rust.  Even tho I don't really compile, I'm a solid writer and I'm happy to ask questions and compile answers.

## Web Based Rust Tools

I posed this question on Twitter tonight: 

> Given the amazing response to my comments about programs written in Rust, I would appreciate links to great Rust resources and, particularly, web based tools that Rust devs use. #rustlang 
@steveklabnik, @bcantrill [PermaLink](https://twitter.com/fuzzygroup/status/1542283289867833344)

And, happily, a ton of very smart people took the time to reply.  I compiled all the tools suggested below.

* [http://play.rust-lang.org](http://play.rust-lang.org) - online repl / experimentation tool
* [http://docs.rs](http://docs.rs) - documentation
* [https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/) - nightly build docs
* [https://forge.rust-lang.org/](https://forge.rust-lang.org/) - a repository of supplementary docs
* [https://rust.godbolt.org](https://rust.godbolt.org) - compiler explorer
* [http://app.quicktype.io](http://app.quicktype.io) - JSON parser generator
* [https://crates.io/](https://crates.io/) - component registry - yes I added this; this is a development tool because finding components is a part of development

## Adding to This

Drop me a line on Twitter where I am @fuzzygroup and I'm happy to add any tools you find.
