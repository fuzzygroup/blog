<font size="+1"><b>Marketing 101: Choosing A Name for Your Company</b></font>

I just ran through an IM session with an online / offline friend, Michael Bernstein and I thought it was interesting enough to make an article out of.&nbsp; Here's how it actually started:

> ZopeMaven: Hey there!  
> fuzzygroup: Hey Mike  
> ZopeMaven: got some time?  
> fuzzygroup: Sure  
> ZopeMaven: I need to settle on a company name for myself.  
> fuzzygroup: Ok  
> fuzzygroup: "DemiGodsOfZope" ?  
> ZopeMaven: over the past few years, I've registered a few domain names that I thought might one day be appropriate.  
> fuzzygroup: ok

&nbsp;

ZopeMaven: Hey there!  
fuzzygroup: Hey Mike  
ZopeMaven: got some time?  
fuzzygroup: Sure  
ZopeMaven: I need to settle on a company name for myself.  
fuzzygroup: Ok  
fuzzygroup: "DemiGodsOfZope" ?  
ZopeMaven: over the past few years, I've registered a few domain names that I thought might one day be appropriate.  
fuzzygroup: ok  
ZopeMaven: Hang On I'm going to paste a list in.  
fuzzygroup: ok  
ZopeMaven:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AGILEBRAND.COM  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AGILEBRANDING.COM  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AGILEBRANDS.COM  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AGILEMEDIUM.COM  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AGILESTUDIO.COM  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ARCHISTRUCT.COM  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CRYPTOSOME.COM  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EMORPHEON.COM  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NERDWORLDORDER.COM  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NERDWORLDORDER.NET  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NERDWORLDORDER.ORG  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NEXANA.COM  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOVONIS.COM  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PANHEDRON.COM  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SENSEMAKERS.COM  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SENSEMAKERS.NET  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SENSEMAKERS.ORG  
fuzzygroup: ok.  
fuzzygroup: What will your company be doing  
ZopeMaven: basically, I need to select one as a DBA (like you have 'Fuzzy Group').  
fuzzygroup: Yes -- but how do you plany to make $$$$   
ZopeMaven: I'm doing consulting, I'd like to pursue a focus on weblogs and KM.  
fuzzygroup: PANHEDRON.COM  
fuzzygroup: or nexana.com  
ZopeMaven: And, of course I've got a fair amount of Zope expertise.  
fuzzygroup: the reason I picked those 2 was that both are pretty phonetic   
fuzzygroup: and ambiguous  
fuzzygroup: also "pan" means all  
fuzzygroup: and "nexana" has a relationship to nexus  
ZopeMaven: yeah pnhedron == all sides  
fuzzygroup: Yup  
ZopeMaven: Ok.  
fuzzygroup: A lot of times as a consultnat you network at conferences, cocktail hours, etc.&nbsp; So something phonetic is really good, iMHO.  
ZopeMaven: I eliminated a few out of the list I pasted BTW, such as PROPELLERBEANIES.COM :-)  
fuzzygroup: lol  
fuzzygroup: SenseMakers is also good  
fuzzygroup: didn't see that one 1st time.  
ZopeMaven: So how would you order your top picks from this list?  
fuzzygroup: SenseMakers (if you can also get sensemaker) Panhedron Nexana  
fuzzygroup: The order on the last two is flip a coin though  
ZopeMaven: sensemaker was taken at the time I regitered these... let me check now...  
fuzzygroup: ok.&nbsp; [www.000domains.com](http://www.000domains.com) is $13 only and rocks  
ZopeMaven: it's taken.  
fuzzygroup: Then do the last 2 or someone will use sensemaker.com instead  
fuzzygroup: guaranteed!!!  
ZopeMaven: Those would have been my top picks too, although I would have included novonis as well.  
fuzzygroup: felt like a drug company to me  
ZopeMaven: heh.  
fuzzygroup: well it did!  
ZopeMaven: don't get your panties in a bunch... :-) I wasn't arguing with you.  
fuzzygroup: oh i know  
fuzzygroup: i was teasing you too   
ZopeMaven: Ok, if sensemakers is off the table, then I think I'll be going with panhedron.  
fuzzygroup: Sounds good.  
fuzzygroup: Hey!&nbsp; Here's an idea.&nbsp; Can I convert this transcript to a Marketing 101: Picking a Name for Your Business ?  
ZopeMaven: Sure.  
fuzzygroup: cool.&nbsp; Off to the races I will charge -- after I write some more code once the pizza arrives that is  
ZopeMaven: do you want to keep the references to the actual names, or do you want to change them?  
fuzzygroup: Oh no.&nbsp; Keep 'em.  
ZopeMaven: Other names I dropped from the list I pasted are webmaven.org and webonomicon.com  
fuzzygroup: that's what makes it interesting.  
fuzzygroup: Cool.  
fuzzygroup: It should get you some attention perhaps as well.  
ZopeMaven: Sure.  
fuzzygroup: Can you give me 2 sentences as to what specifically you want to charge for (i.e. some more detail) ?  
ZopeMaven: I'll have to design a logo for the site and the cards.  
ZopeMaven: mm.  
fuzzygroup: How about this then  
ZopeMaven: Michael Bernstein

fuzzygroup: Cool.  
fuzzygroup: Perfect  
ZopeMaven: Ooops.  
ZopeMaven: Just a second.  
ZopeMaven: I forgot a few more, but the probably aren't relevant:  
fuzzygroup: nprb.&nbsp; i'm starting to write now so I'm going to focus in since I have a few minutes.&nbsp;   
ZopeMaven: OPENBLUEPRINT.COM (.NET, .ORG)  
SOURCEFOUNDRY.COM (.NET, .ORG)

ZopeMaven: Ok, that was it.  
fuzzygroup: great  
ZopeMaven: I assume you'll be linking to the selected name (panhedron.com) from your article?

fuzzygroup: I always try to lend a hand when I can
