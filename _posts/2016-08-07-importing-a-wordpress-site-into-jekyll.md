Just a heads up if you're using Jekyll, [WordPress import](https://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/wordpressdotcom/) does actually work but it is mildly tricky.  Install the jekyll-import gem and it will work bt ryou need to instal  a handfull of other gems for it to work.  This was first identified back in 2013 and its apparently still an [issue](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-import/issues/58).  Once you work thru it though, I can confirm that it does work quite well.
