<p>This has absolutely frightening implications for people that make content management systems where the default templates are NOT ADA compliant (UserLand, MovableType, Blogger&nbsp;take note).</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013031121/http://(scubacuda)%20(at)%20(iname.com)/">scubacuda</a> writes <i>"<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013031121/http://www.law.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/View&amp;c=LawArticle&amp;cid=1032128683422&amp;t=LawArticleTech">According to Law.com</a>, Robert Gumson, a blind man who uses a program that converts website content into speech, is suing Southwest Airlines (with the help of Miami Beach, FL-based <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013031121/http://www.adaaccessnow.org/">Access Now</a>) for its website being incompatible with his screen-reader program. The case has been filed under the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013031121/http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/ada/adahom1.htm">Americans with Disabilities Act</a> under the untested legal theory that ADA provisions on the accessibility of public accommodations to the disabled apply to Internet Web sites just as they do to brick-and-mortar facilities like movie theaters and department stores. There have been previous lawsuits alleging that the ADA applies to the Internet, but all have settled without a ruling on the merits: 1999 the National Federation of the Blind sued AOL alleging its service was inaccessible to blind users (AOL agreed to make its sites compatible with screen reader technology); over the past two years, Access Now has sued Barnes &amp; Noble and Claire's Stores for maintaining Web sites that allegedly violated the ADA (both settled)."</i></p>

<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">Having just build and released an ADA compliant site for a client I have mixed feelings about this.&nbsp; With the Internet making everyone in the world a publisher does this mean that everyone in the world has to support ADA compliance?&nbsp; I can understand government websites being required to be compliant but Southwest?&nbsp; Or my blog?&nbsp; Once you go down this road it's a very slippery slope.&nbsp; Here's hoping Southwest wins the lawsuit and doesn't cave.&nbsp; That would be a bad precedent.&nbsp; </p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">[On an aside I hope that they do make their site ADA compliant but of their own volition just because it makes business sense not because of this lawsuit].</p
