    <p>One of the best bits of computer science I ever learned, I learned in 1989 from my first business partner, Brian Giedt.  We were at a Society for Technical Communications (stc) conference on Technical Documentation and my partner was trying to impress a pretty girl.  And I watch him look at an animation product and pretty much instantly <strong>grok</strong> how it was doing the animation.  Where I saw a pretty flow of images, he looked at it and understood how the animation was being done.  That was the very first time I saw someone really understand something about the <em>internals</em> from its <em>externals</em>.  And once I knew it was possible – I’ve striven to do it as often as I can.  Very often, if you set up the right set of circumstances, you’ll realize exactly how something has to be implemented internally.</p>

<p>Let’s use Dropbox as an example.  We all know that Dropbox transfers the content you put in it to all other machines you have hooked up to it.  And that’s a simple 1 to many transfer.  But how does Dropbox work when you already have content in it and you re-arrange it?  Does it resend everything or does it figure out what it has to do and send a command stream to do it instead?</p>

<p>A few minutes ago I:</p>

<ul>
  <li>created a folder within a folder in Dropbox</li>
  <li>moved about 15 gb of video files in initial folder to the new folder</li>
  <li>checked on my iPad about a minute later</li>
</ul>

<p>And all the files I moved were in the new folder already.  Here’s what this tells me</p>

<ul>
  <li>There’s no way that Dropbox deleted and re-transmitted the files in that time; it is simply impossible</li>
  <li>What Dropbox has to be doing is sending commands that amount to move THIS from HERE to THERE</li>
</ul>

<p>The best I’ve seen to do this is you set up conditions that you know can’t be argued with by physical constraints.  I knew that 15 gb of video data was a big arse chunk of data.  If I had used say a megabyte, well, I wouldn’t have really known if it was a full bandwidth re-arrange or a command stream.  By setting up such a large test, well, I knew something smarter had to be going on.</p>
