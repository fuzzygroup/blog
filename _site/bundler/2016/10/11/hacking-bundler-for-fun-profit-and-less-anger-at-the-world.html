  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I recently wrote a blog post about my rage at Bundler and the fact that I have to manually remember than when the command:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>gem install json -v1.8.1
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>blows up, I have to remember to instead use:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>gem install json -v1.8.3
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>As someone who has consulted on a LOT of different ruby code bases, I see this constantly.  At times it feels that every time I start a project I have to face some kind of gem / bundler issue.  Now my friend Nick would argue that this is really something best solved by Docker and he does have a point.</p>

<p>But me?  I’m stubborn.  I want this fixed and I’m finally willing to stop bitching and write some code to do so.  I mean that’s what open source is about.</p>

<h1 id="the-solution">The Solution</h1>

<p>People are universally bad at remembering complex things.  And when complex things have negative contexts, they are even worse at remembering them.  I <strong>hate</strong> gem failures.  And I don’t mean I hate them a little - gem install failures send me into a rage.  And every time I fix it, I promptly forget about it.  What I want to do is tell bundler about the solution I found to the problem.  I want bundler to <strong>learn</strong>.  Here’s my proposed syntax:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>bundle learn bad="" good=""
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>And here’s an actual example:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>bundle learn bad="gem install json -v1.8.1" good="gem install json -v1.8.3"
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>So what do we need to make a learn option work?  Here’s my initial thoughts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We need to add learn as an option with two parameters, good and bad.</li>
  <li>We need a method which takes the two parameters and saves them to disc</li>
  <li>We need test coverage</li>
  <li>We need to hook into the overall failure mode and display any things that we learned that have a close match to the actual failure.</li>
  <li>Long term: Allow these learnings to be shared over the Internet so that other people can benefit from the issues that you solved.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="the-context---in-the-minivan">The Context - In the Minivan</h1>

<p>When I thought of this I was out and about with my wife and teenage son on <em>The Great Home Schooling Lobster Misadventure</em>.  While they were shopping before we picked up the lobster that we needed, I thought of this sitting in a minivan in the parking lot.  I don’t have a lot of time and I don’t have much in the way of connectivity so here’s what I did:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Found the <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler">bundler source</a> on github.</li>
  <li>Forked it to my <a href="https://github.com/fuzzygroup/bundler">github account</a>.</li>
  <li>Cloned it to my local box.</li>
  <li>Changed to the right directory.</li>
  <li>Set the ruby version with RVM.</li>
  <li>Opened the directory in TextMate with mate .</li>
  <li>Read DEVELOPMENT.md and do steps 1 (groff), 2 (dependencies) 3 (run tests) and 4 (shell alias).</li>
  <li>Try and figure out where this might go.  And fail <strong>miserably</strong> – bundler is big!</li>
</ol>

<p>If you think about the code that I want to write, I actually don’t need to understand very much about bundler.  All I need to do, at least to start, is add a command line option that writes some data to a file.  Making this get looked up by a bundler failure obviously will be harder.</p>

<h1 id="search-to-the-rescue">Search to the Rescue!</h1>

<p>Whenever I’m faced with a complex code base and the need to find an integration point, I always, always do the same thing – I <strong>search</strong>.  My rationale was this:</p>

<p>There must be a relatively unused command line option in bundler.  If its relatively unused there won’t be a lot of calls to it so finding it should be simple.</p>

<p>Running bundle –help and paging thru the results showed me the viz option which I had never heard of.  Here’s a screen shot:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/bundler_viz.png" alt="bundler_viz.png" /></p>

<h1 id="hacking-clirb">Hacking cli.rb</h1>

<p>What I found was cli.rb where there was a method that seemed to indicate that you could patch in.  Here’s what it looks like:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>desc "viz [OPTIONS]", "Generates a visual dependency graph"
long_desc &lt;&lt;-D
  Viz generates a PNG file of the current Gemfile as a dependency graph.
  Viz requires the ruby-graphviz gem (and its dependencies).
  The associated gems must also be installed via 'bundle install'.
D
method_option :file, :type =&gt; :string, :default =&gt; "gem_graph", :aliases =&gt; "-f", :desc =&gt; "The name to use for the generated file. see format option"
method_option :format, :type =&gt; :string, :default =&gt; "png", :aliases =&gt; "-F", :desc =&gt; "This is output format option. Supported format is png, jpg, svg, dot ..."
method_option :requirements, :type =&gt; :boolean, :default =&gt; false, :aliases =&gt; "-R", :desc =&gt; "Set to show the version of each required dependency."
method_option :version, :type =&gt; :boolean, :default =&gt; false, :aliases =&gt; "-v", :desc =&gt; "Set to show each gem version."
method_option :without, :type =&gt; :array, :default =&gt; [], :aliases =&gt; "-W", :banner =&gt; "GROUP[ GROUP...]", :desc =&gt; "Exclude gems that are part of the specified named group."
def viz
  require "bundler/cli/viz"
  Viz.new(options.dup).run
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>So what I need is a similar routine that gets called when the learn option is entered on the command line.  My first several attempts were fairly miserable failures but here’s what I ended up with:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>desc "learn [OPTIONS]", "Allows bundler to learn that what to do when a command is broken"

long_desc &lt;&lt;-D
  learn stores your personal approach to getting around gem breakages.
  Example: bundle learn bad="gem install json -v1.8.1" good="gem install json -v1.8.3".
  will prompt you with the correct command when the failure occurs
D
method_option "bad", :type =&gt; :string, :default =&gt; "", :aliases =&gt; "-b", :desc =&gt; "The bad gem command"
method_option "good", :type =&gt; :string, :default =&gt; "", :aliases =&gt; "-g", :desc =&gt; "The good gem command"

def learn
  require "bundler/cli/learn"
  raise "Hit learn!!!"
  Learn.new(options.dup).run
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>That require statement means that I needed to create bundler/cli/learn.rb immediately or I’d get a nasty missing file error.  No big deal though.</p>

<p>This can be called with:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code> dbundle learn --bad="gem install json -v '1.8.1'" --good="update your ruby"
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>or</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code> dbundle learn --bad="gem install json -v '1.8.1'" --good="gem install json -v1.8.3"
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Note: Its called dbundle in this example since I have a local shell alias so my modified bundler will be run instead of bundler itself.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of the output:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>dbundle learn --bad="gem install json --version='1.7.3'" --good="update your ruby"

<p>If you think about what this needs to do, it looks something like this:</p>

  <li>Figure out if what you’re telling it to learn is a duplicate or not.</li>
  <li>Write a file to some kind of local storage which files away the bad, good and machine details.</li>
