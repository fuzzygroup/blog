    <p>So I’ve now started to see all kinds of articles about cloud pricing.  Here are just two examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://thehftguy.com/2016/11/18/google-cloud-is-50-cheaper-than-aws/">Google Cloud is 50% Cheaper than AWS</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://welcome.linode.com/pricing-comparison/?r=6b44fd00604f7059c77db8cb6e821a8c91fa5f8b">Linode Pricing</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And seeing these makes me want to comment that cloud pricing comparisons, generally speaking, are entirely false.  There are two aspects to any kind of pricing comparisons for something like cloud pricing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The $$$</li>
  <li>Your Skills</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s take each of these in turn:</p>

<h1 id="the-">The $$$</h1>

<p>Am I disputing <a href="https://thehftguy.com/2016/11/18/google-cloud-is-50-cheaper-than-aws/">this article</a> by THEHFTGUY?  I mean he has graphs and all and I suspect that he understands cloud pricing really, really well.  I do think that this statement is actually quite unfair:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Google has been designing networks and manufacturing their own equipment for decades. It’s fair to assume than AWS doesn’t have the technology to compete.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And he rounds out his article with two interesting comments:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>AWS was the first generation of cloud, Google is the second. The second generation is always better because it can learn from the mistakes of the first and it doesn’t have the old legacy to support.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>2016 should be remembered as the year Google became a better choice than AWS. If 50% cheaper is not a solid argument, I don’t know what is.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="your-skills">Your Skills</h1>

<p>If you are reading my nerdy ramblings then it is a pretty fair bet that either you are a personal friend, in which case – <strong>Hello Friend</strong>!, or you are a professional developer or you want to be.  Now here’s the reality of being a professional developer – your single greatest asset is <strong>your skills</strong>.  And here’s what I mean by that – my skills in Ruby have made me damn near a million dollars in the past decade.  I’m not bragging, I’m not boasting, I’m stating a fact.  I look at anything I do technically thru a fairly focused lens – is this going to make my skills better or worse?</p>

<p>When I finally made the decision to buckle down and really learn AWS, not simply piddle around the edges with S3, that was actually a tough decision for me.  You see as a professional I’ve made this type of decision before.  From 1987 to 1999 I committed to Microsoft and Windows for all my development activities.  Then in 1999 I found that Windows, at least for me, had run its course and that was when I went all open source for everything, save one brief, damn lucrative engagement.  That was the last time in my life that I went down the proprietary route.</p>
