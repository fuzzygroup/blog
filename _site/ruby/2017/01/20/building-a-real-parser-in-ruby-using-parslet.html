    <p>I deal with “parsing” all the time and I generally do it with one or more regular expressions.  And while I know that JWZ is famous for this statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some people, when confronted with a problem, think “I know, I’ll use regular expressions.” Now they have two problems.  alt.religion.emacs (lost; recovered) <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Jamie_Zawinski">JWZ</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Regular expressions provide a uniquely powerful way to deal with day.  What the don’t do well though is handle problems when you arbitrary complexity / recursion in your structure.  Let’s say you are trying to parse:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“name like ‘%Warning%’”</li>
  <li>“name like ‘%Warning%’ AND name not like ‘%noob%’”</li>
  <li>“name like ‘%Warning%’ AND name not like ‘%blah%’ AND name like ‘%bar%’”</li>
</ul>

<p>You see where this is going – I have an arbitrary SQL like syntax and while I could craft a specialized regex which tried to deal with the max cases and then back off, at best that would be a hack.  At worst it would be code that I’d be ashamed to show Mother Johnson and that would be sad.  This calls for – wait for it – a real <strong>parser</strong>.</p>

<p>And, yes, I am talking about the stuff we all learned in compilers class aka <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Compilers-Principles-Techniques-Tools-2nd/dp/0321486811">The Dragon Book</a>.  If, like me, you didn’t actually take a compilers class then let me explain.  The Dragon Book, for as long as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Book">I can remember</a>, has been the source of how you write compilers, parsers, etc.  Wikipedia cites it back to 1977 and that’s what I mean by “as long as I can remember”.  I know my first startup partner, Brian, used it in college circa 1988 and it has been in constant use, well, forever.</p>

<p>The stuff taught in the Dragon Book are techniques that either you use constantly because they neatly correspond to how you think or they are things you trot out once a decade or so when the problem is that severe.  In my case I last did this stuff in 1996 when I used it to write an HTML parser in Visual Basic.  That time I did it with a Lex / Yacc / Bison grammar using this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/lex-yacc-Doug-Brown-ebook/dp/B009THDEBC">O’Reilly book</a> to assist me.</p>

<p><img src="http://kschiess.github.io/parslet/images/parsley_logo.png" alt="http://kschiess.github.io/parslet/images/parsley_logo.png" /></p>

<p>One of the beautiful things about computers as a profession is that if you’ve ever done something then there’s a near certainty that it will loop back on you.  This time around I am tackling it with Ruby and the <a href="https://github.com/kschiess/parslet">Parslet</a> gem.  I’ve been following Parslet on the mailing list since at least 2014 because I know just how important parsing is and <a href="https://github.com/kschiess">Kaspar Schiess</a> has done fantastic work on it over the years.</p>

<p>Developing a parser with a tool like Parslet is not something you can just sit down and hack out.  This isn’t that kind of gem – I know, I tried it that way.  This is a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>roll up your sleeves</li>
  <li>watch a video</li>
  <li>work thru an example</li>
  <li>scratch your head</li>
  <li>drink coffee</li>
  <li>re-watch the video</li>
  <li>finally get it</li>
  <li>extend the example</li>
</ul>

<p>type of thing.  And that honestly is the exact process I used.  <a href="http://www.dasari.me">Dv</a> and I worked thru it together and we couldn’t make any progress until we sat down and did it this way.  Yes we were able to cobble together a simple grammar but we just couldn’t put all the pieces together without this level of understanding.  But, I can promise you this, once you do actually understand how a tool like Parslet works then it is fundamentally transformative for you.</p>

<p>In our case we started with Calle Erlandson’s Recursive Descent Parsers talk available on <a href="https://youtu.be/_F-eh66zw90">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://github.com/calleerlandsson/recursive-descent-parsers-talk">github</a>.  This is a fantastic video where he walks you through the development of an infix parser for a calculator i.e. “3 + 4 * 2” should be give a result if 11 (8 + 3) because you have to evaluate it mathematically not left to right.  Here is my repository where Dv and I extended Calle’s example to include <a href="https://github.com/fuzzygroup/recursive-descent-parsers-talk">division</a>.  Yes I even sent a pull request over to him to perhaps get division into the master.</p>

<p>I know I wrote a lot of words and didn’t even talk about parsing SQL like expressions.  That’s because priorities got shifted and, just after getting ourselves ready to tackle the real project, it was a case of “And now please do this instead”.  Sigh.  I’m sure I’ll come back to this topic but really do watch the video – it is fantastic.</p>
