<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Hello, J. Scott Johnson!</span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt"></span></font>
<p> </p>

<p><strong><font face="Times New Roman" color="navy" size="4"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 14pt; COLOR: navy">Yes, its been a over a year </span></font></strong> since Ive written and sent one of these newsletters reporting on progress with The War Against The Chtorr.  I apologize for that.  Mea culpa, my bad, and I will go have myself flogged as soon as I can find a red-haired dominatrix who owns a chocolate store.  (Im not even going to try to explain why its taken so long.  But if youre reading this, it means we finally figured out how to get mail-merge working in Office XP.  If youre not reading this, dont worry about it.)</p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt"></span></font>
<p> </p>

<p><strong><font face="Times New Roman" color="navy" size="4"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 14pt; COLOR: navy">Welcome to the New Folks!</span></font> </strong> We receive as many as a hundred requests a month from folks asking for information about the next book.  I dont have time to answer all the e-mails and I apologize for that.  Please forgive.  Thats why we started this occasional newsletter so I could respond to all the e-mails and keep folks informed.  I hope youll find it worthwhile;  if not, let me know and Ill remove your name from the list.  (If youre getting multiple copies, please let me know about that too.)  To those of you whove been around for a bit, thanks for your patience as well as your enthusiasm. </p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt"></span></font>
<p> </p>

<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial Rounded MT Bold'">As a way of saying thanks to everyone, Im including a special preview of book five at the bottom of this newsletter.  Some of these chapters were posted on my website, but I think this is more than anyone else has seen yet.  We will have more preview chapters in future newsletters.  </span></font>

<p><strong><font face="Times New Roman" color="navy" size="4"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 14pt; COLOR: navy"></span></font></strong>  </p>

<p><strong><font face="Times New Roman" color="red" size="4"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 14pt; COLOR: red">Progress on <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">A METHOD FOR MADNESS</span></i>:</span></font> </strong> Since last year Ive had three major writing spurts.  The total number of words finished is now more than 250,000 words, not counting all the stuff that will go between the chapters.  So this is already the biggest book in the series, and theres still as much as 50,000 words left to write. </p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt"></span></font>
<p> </p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">In this book, Jim gets to go deep down inside the Amazon mandala, not just whats on the surface, but whats underneath as well.  And then, later on, he gets to discover whats under </span></font>
<p>Manhattan as well.  The parallels and contrasts between the two sequences promise to be spooky.  But of course its also a lot of work.  Even though two-thirds of it is already written, Im exhausted just thinking about the parts left to write. </p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt"></span></font>
<p> </p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">So it looks like <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">A Method For Madness</span></i> could grow to 300,000 words or more.   Oh yes, and theres also this one sequence where Jim finally explains whats really going on with the worms.  Thats worth a couple of Yikes!  It brought me out of my chair a couple of times as I realized some additional implications of the invasion.  So Ive given up trying to predict when it will be done.  As long as Im this enthusiastic, Im just going to let it keep growing.  It will probably be the equivalent of three ordinary novels.  I hope you wont mind.</span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt"></span></font>
<p> </p>

<p><strong><font face="Times New Roman" color="red" size="4"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 14pt; COLOR: red">Publishing Plans:</span></font></strong>   <em>A Method For Madness</em> will be published in hardcover, but no date has been set yet.  If I can finish the book before the end of summer, it will be published next year.  Tor Books has also bought the rights to reprint the first four books, along with the fifth book.  Right now, theyre talking about publishing A Matter For Men and A Day For Damnation as one volume, and A Rage For Revenge and  Season For Slaughter as a second volume.  They havent said whether they will do paperback or hardcover.  If you want hardcover editions write to Tor books and let them know.  I figure that if they know that there are several thousand folks ready to buy hardcovers thats enough to justify the expense.  (Tor Books, 175 Fifth Ave., New York, NY 10010-7703.)  Dont put my name on the envelope or theyll forward it to me as fan mail.  In fact, dont even tell them I told you to write. </p>

<p><strong><font face="Times New Roman" color="red" size="4"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 14pt; COLOR: red">The Man Who Folded Himself:</span></font></strong>   The first publisher of this book called it the last word in time travel stories and a lot of readers seemed to agree.  Its now considered a classic novel of science fiction and BenBella Books has just published a trade paperback edition with a very nice introduction by Robert Sawyer, and a very nice afterword by Goeffrey Klempner.  Its a handsome package and BenBella even has some autographed copies for sale on their website.  (<a href="http://www.benbellabooks.com">http://www.benbellabooks.com</a>.)  Well also be at Westercon in Seattle. </p>

<p><strong><font face="Times New Roman" color="red" size="4"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 14pt; COLOR: red">The Martian Child:</span></font></strong>   This is the novel-length version of the story that won the Hugo and the Nebula awards in 1995 the nearly-true story of my sons adoption.  The book is now available in trade paperback and it is highly recommended by my publisher, my son, and the bank that holds my mortgage.  The Martian Child might be a little hard to find in bookstores, so I recommend ordering it online.  Some of the reviewers werent as warm to it as Id hoped (Its been called everything from charmingly neurotic to relentlessly honest to embarrassingly earnest.  Go figure.), but quite a few readers seem to have taken it to heart.  See if you can spot the references to the Chtorr in the book.  Meanwhle, Sean just turned nineteen and hes showing dangerous signs of turning into a human being, so somebody must have done something right.</p>

<p><strong><font face="Times New Roman" color="red" size="4"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 14pt; COLOR: red">The Dingilliad:</span></font></strong>   <em>Leaping To The Stars</em>, the third (and final, I think) book in the Dingilliad series was published last April to generally favorable reviews.  It was a tricky book to write because I was juggling about six different watermelons.  (I did drop one, at least I think I did, but I wont tell you which one, because nobody else seems to have noticed.)  The first two books, <em>Jumping Off The Planet</em> and <em>Bouncing Off The Moon</em>, are out in paperback.  You can order all of them at Amazon, of course.  All three are also available in one volume, from the Science Fiction Book Club as <em>The Far Side Of The Sky</em>.  Reviewers and readers continue to compare the books favorably to the classic Heinlein juveniles, which is a nice compliment, but a little inaccurate.  Yes, theres a Heinlein flavor, but its only a spice.  I like to think that theres a lot more Gerrold than Heinlein in these books.  Read them for yourself and let me know what you think.  (By the way, a favorite character from the Chtorr series has a very nice chapter in <em>Leaping To The Stars.</em>)</p>

<p><strong><font face="Times New Roman" color="red" size="4"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 14pt; COLOR: red">Worlds of Wonder:</span></font></strong>   Writers Digest Books asked me to do a book on how to write science fiction and fantasy, so I took all the best lessons Id learned from Harlan Ellison, Theodore Sturgeon, Samuel R. Delaney, James Blish, D.C. Fontana, A. E. Van Vogt, and others, and compiled them into Worlds of Wonder.  Its gotten some good reader reaction;  if you want to know more about writing, or more about how I approach writing, pick up a copy.  (The Science Fiction Book Club published World of Wonder as a recent selection, but didnt send me any copies.  If anyone has a copy of the Book Club edition theyd like to donate or trade, let me know please.)  And yes, theres a Chtorran chapter in this book too.</p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">The chopper jerked in the air. The pilot pulled the machine around in a tight turn, nearly sliding us sideways out the open door. Lizard grabbed for mea reflex. She clutched at my arm only for a moment, then pulled herself up, swearing like a longshoreman. Angrily, she began untying the restraints that still held her firmly in her stretcher. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">We tilted hard then and I stared straight down at another chopper just dropping down out of the air, landing in the red-stained jungle below usin a clearing carved by a daisy-cutter bomb, dotted with scattered tents and crates of supplies and the wreckage of the <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Hieronymus Bosch</span></i>. The aircraft became the instant center of a scrambling cluster of soldiers and civilians. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">We tilted again, righting ourselves this time, and I saw another chopper, orbiting the camp opposite us. Its guns were firing away at something in the distance. I became aware of the soundsred and purple screeches, punctuated with the thudding blasts of explosions, both near and far. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">What are you doing? Lizard demanded of the pilot. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Orders. We have to orbit and provide covering fire until the chopper behind us gets off the ground. Then hell provide cover for the next one. And so on. He grinned back at us. Sit back and enjoy the ride. Youll get the best view of the war yet. I guarantee you. The pilot was a stocky kid with a ruddy complexion. He looked like he was having a terrific time. Probably, he was. Copilot was pointing at something and shouting. Behind us, the two gunners were launching cold-rockets, one after the other, with alarming enthusiasm. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Lizard and I exchanged a glance. It was amateur night. She looked annoyed as hell. Frustrated beyond words. I was sure she would have preferred to fly us out herself. The other passengers in this lifeboat looked equally unhappy. Wed lifted off with four GIs, two torch-bearers, and a corpsman. I wondered what theyd been through. The torch-bearers looked exhausted. The others just seemed terrifiedas if theyd had a glimpse down the mouth of hell. Probably they had. The corpsman had his eyes closed and was reciting his prayers. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">We circled around the evacuation camp and I caught a glimpse of the pink skin of the <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Bosch</span></i> sprawled across the jungle canopy. It stretched out for acres. Parts of it still ballooned upward like gigantic bulging breasts and stomachs and arms. Other parts sagged like the shrunken skin of a corpse. Here and there, metallic bones shone through, poking brokenly upward. I saw red maggots crawling across the body</span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">All right, were clear, the pilot called. I looked down as we banked and saw the other chopper lifting off. The next one came dropping down behind it. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Lizard had climbed forward, to stare past the pilots shoulder. Now, she reached forward and grabbed his shoulder. What are you doing? she demanded. Youre heading <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">south! </span></i></span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Wanna get a better look, the pilot said. Never seen worms up close before. He pointed ahead. Look! </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">By now, I had loosened the bonds on my stretcher, and dragged myself halfway forward too. Despite the splints, my knee still twinged with fire every time I moved. Behind me, the corpsman made cautionary noises about my leg. I told him to stuff it.  After what Id just been through, this was luxury. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Peering ahead through the clear dome of the vehicle, I could see what had excited the pilot. A fantastic river of huge scarlet bodies poured through the jungle. Thousands of Chtorran gastropedes from the Japuran mandala were pursuing the great sky-god that had passed across the roof of their world. Their song was audible even over the steady <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">thwup-thwup</span></i> of the choppers blades and the droning roar of its engines. The two young men in the cockpit seemed fascinated, almost to the point of being stupefied. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Lizard was shouting at them. Dont be stupid! Dont you know the Chtorran ecology is hostile to aircraft engines! </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Relax, honey, the pilot said. Youre in good hands. Let the men handle this. Gently, he disengaged her hand from his shoulder. Ill drive. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Copilot pointed downward. Lets get close-ups </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Right. Theyll be worth a fortune. What do you think <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Newsleak</span></i> will pay? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Lizard was unfastening something from her collar. One of her stars. She reached around and held it up in front of the pilots eyes. She waited until she was sure that he had focused and recognized it. My name is not honey, she said. It is General Tirelli, <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">sir!</span></i> And you will turn this fucking ship around and head north for Yuana Moloco, right now, or I will drag you out of that seat and fly it myself. That is a direct order. Acknowledge it <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">now!</span></i> </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I had to give the kid credit. He didnt flinch. Sorry, maam. I have standing orders to do a photo reconnaissance. You may be a general, but my commanding officer is an even bigger son-of-a-bitch. He brushed her hand away. You can threaten me all you want, but Im still flying this rig, and if you interfere with my piloting again, Ill file formal charges against you the minute we touch down. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Lizard was tired and weak. Otherwise the expression on her face would have put him into the hospital. Or perhaps she knew she couldnt win this argument. I crawled laboriously forward. Who gave you those orders, Captain? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">It was the use of the word <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Captain</span></i> that got him. He said, Standard operating procedure for all Chtorran operations requires </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">In </span></font>
<p>North America, yes, I agreed. But not here. The general was right. Theres lumps in the air. Some of them big enough to hurt. What do you think brought down the dirigible?</p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">He didnt answer. Not right away. He busied himself with buttons and knobs for a minute, pretending to be checking something. Suddenly he spoke in a whole other tone of voice, Listenevery other goddamn son-of-a-bitch in the world is getting a chance to burn these mothers. And every other goddamn son-of-a-bitch in the world except me is getting rich off them. This is my chance to make some money, and not you, <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">not anybody</span></i>, is going to stop me. Understand? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I lowered my voice. I got it. Loud and clear. Just one more question. Is it worth dying for? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">He shook it away. I know what Im doing, he said. Ive logged nearly a hundred hours in the simulator. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I looked at Lizard. Oh, god, I said. He sounds like me. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">She was too frustrated to appreciate the joke. Wearily, she repinned her star onto her collar. She leaned forward and wrapped her arms around metaking care not to bump my knee. She was tired and her hug was feeble, but it meant the world to me. We pulled ourselves closer together and she rested her head on my shoulder. Luna, she whispered. Were going to Luna. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Why not one of the L5s? I whispered back. Wed have Earth-normal gravity. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">We can get a better salad on the moon. And there are no steaks on the L5s yet. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Good point. Wed better go before you start showing. Can you arrange it in the next three months? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">How fast can you pack? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Im already packed. I have everything I want right here. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">As soon as I can get to a phone </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">The chopper lurched then. Both Lizard and I glanced forward, but the pilot seemed unconcerned. Speed bump, he explained. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Lizards expression said it all. She didnt believe him. She saw me looking at her and smiled reassuringly. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Problem? I asked. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">She shook her head. Just my overworked imagination. But she held up a hand for silence while she listened intently to the sound of the engines. I couldnt hear anything; they sounded fine to me, but Lizard narrowed her eyes at something. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">She leaned forward again. Whats that gleebling noise? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">The pilot replied in a laconic drawl. Gleebling is normal for these frammis-whackers. If it were a <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">greebling</span></i> noise, however, then wed have something to worry about. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Copilot added, Gleebling means good evening in the Drunk-to-English dictionary. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Lizard ignored them both. What does the FADPAC<a title="" href="outbind://22-0000000034D20E1153851145A88577AC384D08FEC4AF4300/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">[1]</span></font></sup></span></sup></span></a> say? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Both pilot and copilot looked up. Lizard looked too. The voice monitor was off. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">You assholes. Whered you learn to fly? </span></font>
<p>Disneyland?! She reached up to switch the unit on</p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">The pilot slapped her hand away. Im flying this bird, lady! </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Not very well! she snapped right back. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I dont need a voice yammering in my ear </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Well, you got one now! Me! </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Get in the back where you belong, goddammit! He turned half-around in his seat, like an angry parent preparing to swing at an errant child. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Lizard had already unholstered her pistol. Now, she clicked the safety off and pointed it directly at his head. Turn. The. Monitor. On. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">He froze. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Copilot reached up slowly and switched on the systems analysis unit. Immediately, the familiar synthetic-female voice of Fay began reporting, Number 2 engine reserve deterioration 6 percent. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Instantly, the pilot reached up and tapped the yellow panel of the device. This would give him a more detailed report. Gas particulate limits exceeded. Non-recoverable performance loss. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">What the hell? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Youve flown through something. That was the bump we felt, I said. Possibly a hovering cloud of stingflies. Theyre invisible. They follow the worms. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I never heard of that </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Gee, thats too bad, I said sympathetically. In that case, maybe we wont crash.  God grants dispensation if you have a good excuse. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">He didnt answer. He was suddenly busy with his controls. So was the copilot. I looked to Lizard. She was watching them both intently. Absent-mindedly, she reholstered her pistol. She began offering suggestions. Suddenly, the argument was over and the three of them were working as a team, discussing their options. I couldnt understand a word of their techno-jargon, but it was clear that all thoughts of the photo-mission had been forgotten. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">North? asked the copilot. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">North, confirmed the pilot. Already, he was swinging the bird around. He looked scared. I actually felt sorry for him. His delusions of immortality had just been shattered. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">As if in confirmation, the chopper lurched again. It was a barely noticeable bump, but the blood drained out of their faces. Immediately, the voice of Fay was reporting, Combined engine performance is now 86 percent. And dropping. A moment later, she added, Pressure failure in the primary set. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Shit! said Lizard. Whats the run-dry time on this bird? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Weve got active-magnetic bearings. The pilot was studying a performance projection. We should be able to make it backif we dont hit anything else. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Lizard looked to me. Her expression said it all. What else do we have to worry about? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I shook my head and shrugged. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Something above us <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">chuffled</span></i>. The rotors? Almost immediately, smoke began pouring out behind us. One of the gunners started screaming. Fay began yammering. Pilot and copilot were both suddenly very busy. Lizard shouted instructions. We lurched and bumped. I looked out my side of the chopper. I could see the smoke streaming away into the distance. There were burning flecks of something churning in the greasy black trail. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Aww, God, no the pilot cried. He was fighting his controls. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Lizard shouted at him, she grabbed his shoulder, and pointed forward.  There!  A wide black streak of water cut through the dark shimmer of the jungle;  on both sides, the forest canopy sparkled with orange.  Head for the river!  Keep away from the trees. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I glanced back. Both the gunners looked pale. The passengers were wailing. The wind grabbed the bird and pushed us sideways. Either it was the windor we were whirling out of control</span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">The jets were suddenly louder. Roaring! We lurched and bounced across the sky. I bumped my head against the roof of the cabin. Then we caught the air again and came swooping down and up in a wild roller-coaster ride through a dizzying starboard turn.  We banked over and around and finally down toward a dark canyon of trees. Too far! -- Abruptly, we pulled hard left and up!  Things went skittering sideways out of the bird, tumbling downward into the jungle. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">The pilot was fighting for control and trying to follow the course of the water, swearing and yelling all at the same time. Copilot was hollering maydays into his mike as fast as he could, yammering like a monkey. The river straightened suddenly and just as improbably so did we, racing lower and lower toward the inky surface. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Slow down! Lizard shouted. Watch for a sand bar </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Im trying! I cant control her! The goddamn intelligence engine is fighting me </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Youre fighting it, she corrected. Ease up! Its trying to compensate for your panic! </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">By now, we were perilously close to the black water below. We skated over shallow stretches of mud and sand and dark eddies with broken trees and branches sticking dangerously up out of them. Our reflection shimmered across the depths, flickering in and out of existence as we crossed the occasional sand flat. The spars in the water stretched up toward us like fingers. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Suddenly, we were stalling, sliding. We bounced! Sheets of water sprayed away from the chopper. We bounced a second timea third! Something <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">spanged</span></i> against the bottom of the ship and we spun around, slipping sideways and turning, then abruptly came crashing to a sudden, jarring stop as something crunched in through the front window, shattering the Plexiglas in all directions, thudding up against the framework, catching the chopper in a tangled grip, holding us sideways and pulling us downward toward the wet stinking river. The water splashed and flooded upward into the cabin. The rotors shrieked and slammed to a sudden halt in the tangle of branches; they exploded in a fury off the top of the ship. The aircraft hissed and crackled. Foam began flooding up and over everything, cascading down the outside of the ship in thick white sheets. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Wed collided with a tree that had toppled into the river. The chopper was caught. And sinking fast. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">We lurched, we slippedand then for a moment, we held where we were, with the water half into the aircraft. Both my legs were submerged and caught. Goddammit! Dammit! Dammit! <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Dammit!</span></i> I started screaming. This isnt fucking fair! Why cant I ever land in one of these things the way the designers intended? I couldnt believe myself. Wed just fallen out of the sky<i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">again</span></i>and I was making jokes. I must be in worse shape than I thought. Lizard! </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Im right here. Im okay We were teetering at a precarious angle. She had to pull herself around so she could get herself into my field of view. Can you move? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Im caught, I think. I craned around. Are we all right? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">We will be. She began tugging at something under the water. I couldnt see what she was doing. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Behind us, one of the gunners was missing; a bloody smear and broken branches marked where he had been. The other one was moaning uncontrollably and clutching his gut. He was bleeding profusely; apparently, his weapon had crunched backward into him at the moment of impact. Two of the GIs were trying to free the third from where she was pinned by a broken limb. The fourth was nowhere to be seen. The corpsman looked dazed. He was still holding his kit on his lap. I didnt see either of the torchmen. I wondered if Id been unconscious. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">What about the pilot? I asked. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Lizard glanced forward. I followed her look. The chopper had skipped across the surface of the river, bouncing and splashing until it was brought to a sudden halt by a tangle of sharp branches. A broken spar had punched not only through the Plexiglas windshield, but also through the pilots chest as well, impaling him in his seat. The branch was thicker than my leg and blood was flowing down its length. The pilot was still making sucking gurgling sounds. Even as we looked, they rattled into silence. I felt sorry for himand angry at the same time. If it hadnt been for his arrogant stupidity</span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">The copilot was still mumbling into his headset. Mayday, mayday, were going downwere going down. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Everything smelled peppermint. Drifts of foam blew past us, they whirled away in the river current. More of it dropped thickly into the cabin. It was supposed to be non-toxic, but Id heard stories of people drowning in it. The chopper bumped and settled a little bit lower in the water. It rose up to my groin and I thought of something else to worry about. Are there piranhas in this river? I asked. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I hope to God not, Lizard said. I think your stretcher is pinned. Can you feel anything? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">My toes are cold, I said. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Can you wiggle them? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I wiggled. I think so. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">All right She climbed over me to the corpsman. She pulled his kit from his hands and started rummaging through it. She came up with a nasty-looking knife and climbed back to me. Im cutting loose the straps.</span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Hurry, I said, as the aircraft settled again, pushing the water up to my waist.</span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">She didnt answer. She was feeling around in the darkness. She took a breath and disappeared into the water beneath me. I glanced backward. The two GIs were grunting and groaning, pushing at the branch that pinned their companion. She was moaning in pain. Every time they moved the branch, even a little, the chopper lurched and sank deeper into the murk. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Stop that! I said. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Fuck you, they explained. They kept pushing. The chopper creaked ominously. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Youre sinking the ship </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Weve gotta get her out! </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Lizard came up, took another breath, and disappeared beneath my legs again. I could feel her hands as she felt her way down the stretcher. I wondered what happened to her gun. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">One of the torch-bearers stuck his head in the door above me. I cant find him, he said. I cant find him! He leaned his weight on the edge of the door frame, pulling that side of the chopper lower. The water crept up my belly. Ive looked all over. I cant find him! </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Who? I asked. I looked around. The injured gunner had disappeared. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">The torchman didnt answer. A gobbet of foam dripped heavily onto his head, tufting like a whipped cream topping. He looked up in annoyance, then dropped away from the door. The foam kept dripping into the cabin like industrial-strength icing. It covered everything with a slippery-greasy film. Islands of it floated everywhere. Where was Lizard? The branches in the front of the aircraft cracked and the aircraft teetered abruptly. Oh godwhat if she got pinned underwater? The river was up to my chest</span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Lizard surfaced next to me, gasped for breath. Almost she said. Just a little bit more And vanished again. I glanced behind me. The trapped woman was screaming; her eyes were white with terror. The water was up to her chin. Her two friends were screaming in rage as they pushed futilely up at the tree. As hard as they pushed up, the tree pushed harder down. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">The woman yelped for air. The chopper rocked alarmingly and the water swept coldly over her face; it receded for a moment, then swept in again. She gasped and choked and coughed. We lurched and sank another six inchesthe water climbed toward my neck. It felt like we were going all the way down this time. The woman clawed vainly for air.  The water frothed around her. I felt her rage. It wasnt fair. And I was terrified that I was seeing a preview of my own death. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">One of the men was screaming in frustration, pounding against the tree, kicking it as hard as he could. He pushed at it with renewed vigor. It didnt do any good. The tree was levered into the chopper like a crowbar. If we went anywhere, it would be down. The other man gulped for air and ducked down into the black water to press his mouth against the womans, trying to ferry oxygen to her, one desperate gasp at a time. She was too panicked too cooperate. She must have struck at him. He came up, his nose bleeding profusely, his face scratched by her claws. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Just as I began to wonder again where Lizard was, she surfaced, took three quick gasps of air, and disappeared again. The water edged up toward my chin. A fat glob of foam drifted past; part of it caught on my cheek. I brushed it away. Something tugged at my legs. It rasped and scraped and thenjust as the aircraft tilted deeper into the waterwhatever was holding me broke free. I leapt backward and up, scrambling toward the open hatch, my leg screaming on fire, me screaming for Lizard. She came up gasping, reaching for me, climbing in the same direction. We pulled each other toward the hatch. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">The others were coming too. The chopper kept on tilting and suddenly the five of us were swimming in a metal hole. We pulled ourselves up onto the frame of the door, scraping roughly over the edge, even as the machine sank away beneath us. The two GIs were dragging the stunned corpsman with them. One of them was retching. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I didnt see the copilot. I didnt know if hed gotten out. The water was rushing into the open hatch of the chopper now, trying to push us back down into it. I almost lost my grip, but Lizard grabbed me by the ass and pushed <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">hard</span></i>! Thanks I glubbed around a mouthful of stinking brackish water. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">And then we were in the river itself, with dark water swirling all around us. We half-swam, half-staggered across a sandbar, then into a deeper rushing channel. I sank for a moment, touched bottom, pushed hard and came back up, coughing, choking, and spitting. My boots weighed me down. The aluminum splint on my leg reduced my mobility. I kept sinkingand thinking <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">isnt this a stupid way to die!  Rescued and then drowned.</span></i></span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Lizard grabbed me by the arm and pulled. We struggled in the water, bouncing painfully off a sunken tree, scraping across the pebbled bottom of the river, and then suddenly ending up on our knees, puking our guts out on a sodden stretch of mud and sand and decaying vegetation. Lizard pounded me on the back until I begged her incoherently to stop. I collapsed face down on the ground, rolled over and looked at the sky and listened to my heart pound. The sky was still bluedeep and dark and brilliant, it blazed with pink tufts of clouds. A reminder of our precarious position. But we were still alive. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I turned my head to the left and saw only water. To the right, I saw the corpsman and one GI. I didnt see the other one. Hadnt he made it? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Gasping, Lizard collapsed next to me. Stay with me, JimI need you. I was racked with spasmodic coughs and she was nearly paralyzed with the exhaustion of her struggles.  Both of us gulped for air. We lay in the mud and concentrated on our breathing. Periodically, she would reach over and touch me, my hand, my leg, my shoulder. Periodically, I reached over and touched her too, reassuring myself that she was still alive, still with me. I couldnt believe it. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Finally, we helped each other sit up. I looked at herit was like looking at a mirror.  We were both so scared for each other.  Lizards hair hung in wet strings, and there were tears running down her muddy cheeks, but we laughed with unembarrassed relief. What is this? I asked. Our third or our fourth air crash? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Third, she said. And weve got to stop meeting like this. The FAA is getting suspicious. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Maybe we should have been more worried about the others. But first we were being selfish. We were taking care of ourselves. After all wed been througheverything of the past few months as well as the past few dayswed earned it. Wed both been hurt in the dirigible crash, both been trapped.  Id broken my knee, Lizard had been pinned in the wreckage, and Id had to pull a gun on one officer and brutalize a retarded woman to get Lizard rescued by a remote-controlled prowler, just moments before a gastropede the size of a bus reached her.  And then Id had the hubris to think that we were finally safe, that we were finally getting out of the goddamned Amazon basin</span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Theres no such thing as winter in the Amazon.  It sprawls across the equator like a rumpled green bedspread with insects. There are only two seasons in the Amazon: hot and wet. During hot, much of the basin is under water.  During wet, more of the basin is under water.  Before the </span></font>
<p>Andes were born, the river drained to the west;  after plate-tectonics had done its work, there was a ten-thousand kilometer barrier all the way down the western side, in some places six kilometers high, so the river puddled up across the entire continent until it finally drained east.  In some places, the river is so wide, you cant see the opposite shore.  In most places, everything squelches when you walk.  Some people think the Amazon is beautiful. </p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Upriver, a bump in the black water outlined where the chopper had sunk. The current flowed over it like a drape. Nearby, part of a rotor blade stabbed up out of the water like an errant flagpole.  Everywhere, the haze of gnats and buzzing insects.</span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">The other torch-bearernot the one whod poked his head into the chopper, but the <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">other</span></i> onewas dragging something out of the water, a bright red box. Two other boxes were floating in the same shallow eddies. Survival and rescue kits. The copilot was sitting alone on the sand with a fourth box. He was holding his gut, rocking himself, and crying. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Can you walk? Lizard asked me. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I dont know, they wouldnt let me try. Dr. Shreiber had me tied down and doped up and probably under guard as well. I dont even know how bad my knee is. I never even saw an X-ray. I can tell you it hurts like hell, despite the local anesthetic. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">We need to get to higher ground. She stood up to wave.  She shouted weakly at the others. Here! Over here! He needs help walking. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Solomon Short</span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Somehow, we gathered ourselves into a group.  There were six of us; the GI, the torch-bearer, the corpsman, the copilot, Lizard, and me. The copilot had gone silent; he looked brittle and nasty, as if hed been betrayed.  As if he blamed Lizard for the crash.  The corpsman was still in shock; he mumbled and staggered and had to be guided by the arm. The torchmans expression was hard and uncomfortable; I recognized the look. He was expecting the jungle to erupt in purple horrors any minute. If hed been part of the drop-team defending the evacuation site, he had ample justification to wear that look. The GIs expression was unreadable, withdrawn; but he kept looking at me nastily. I knew he resented me for the death of the woman in the chopper. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Lizard looked beautiful to me. She was dirty and she stank of the river and her uniform clung wetly. Her hair was a stringy tangle of mats, her face was pale, and she looked weak. She moved slowly, as if every step was an effort, and her voice was hoarse and cracking. She was gorgeous. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Sitting up painfully, using only my arms, I tried to pull myself backward, higher up the shore, but my leg twinged with every movement. I wondered what further damage the crash might have done. Maybe the corpsman would be able to do something, but I doubted it. I was afraid to trust his judgment just now. The others stood around, waiting for someone to make a decision. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">As weak as she was from her own ordeal, trapped three days in the wreckage of the dirigible, Lizard somehow found the strength to take charge. First, she ordered the GI and the torchman to carry me up to higher ground. The GI scowled resentfully; he didnt like mehe barely touched me, he didnt even want my arm across his shoulders. He held himself away, guiding me mostly and not letting me put any weight on him; but the torchman was bigger and better able to shoulder most of my weight anyway. He practically carried me. My leg screamed the whole way. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Everything stank. The air was humid and full of ripe unfamiliar smells. The heat of the sun turned the day into a steambath. The sweat rolled off us in dirty rivulets.  There wasnt much ground that was really <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">higher</span></i>, but we found a spit of land that was a little less muddy than the rest and slogged up onto it.  Lizard had to lean on the copilot for strength, but she walked most of the way herself. The corpsman trailed along behind us, mumbling like a madman. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">The torch-bearer lowered me carefully to a piece of ground that looked dryer than the rest, and Lizard sank wearily down next to me, breathing hard. I was worried about her; she looked like she was reaching the end of her strength. She noticed me worrying and reached over to pat my shoulder in reassurance, but the way her hand slipped away at the end betrayed her exhaustion. She didnt have the same reserves of energy the rest of us did. Shed already used hers up before being loaded onto the chopper. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Listen, she said. I know were all hurting. But weve got to She stopped to cough. I didnt like the sound of that. weve got to get the emergency kits out of the river before they wash away. She was amazing. In spite of everything shed been through, she was still able to think and act like a commanding officer. She directed the GI and the torchman and the copilot to gather up all four of the red emergency kits and drag them over here to our temporary camp. The corpsman wandered around for a bit until she ordered him to sit down in one place and stay there. Surprisingly, he did. Despite the seriousness of her condition, she still had the presence of mind to watch out for the rest of us. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">After the kits were secured, she sent the GI and the torch-bearer out again, this time on a quick lookaround to see if anyone else aboard the chopper had survived, or if any other usable gear or weaponry had somehow escaped the sinking of the machine. We didnt really expect there to be any other survivors, we probably would have seen them by now if there were; but we didnt have a confirmed death on the other GIs or the other torch-bearer and we had to give them every chance possible. They headed downriver first. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Lizard and copilothis name was Kruger and he acted resentfultook immediate stock of our survival gear. She wouldnt let me help, she was afraid Id cause further injury to my knee. Instead, she made me wrap myself up in a mylar heating blanket and wait. I grumbled, but I followed orders and switched the blanket on.  Despite the heat of the day, I was shivering.  That wasnt good.</span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Working together, the two of them quickly inflated three raft-tents and the communications buoy. Three silvery balloons puffed themselves full and rose straight up into the sky, lifting a long Mylar tether after them.  I watched as they dropped away upward, until they disappeared in the high blueness. The tether was more than a kilometer in length with the balloons spaced equidistantly at the one-third, two-thirds, and topmost points.  The topmost balloon had a transponder-beacon visible to satellites and skybirds, and the skins of the balloons were corner-dimpled to give them brighter-than-normal signatures; theyd reflect radar and laser beams directly back to the sender, showing up on anyones display screen as an urgent hot spot.  The buoy hung high and invisible in the air above us, broadcasting its silent pleas for help.  Lizard grabbed a military-issue clipboard from one of the kits and switched on the GPS; within thirty seconds, its display showed our location 40 klicks northwest of the Japuran mandala.  </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Tiny flying insects filled the air;  we waved them away from our faces, the effort was useless.  They were in our eyes and mouths and nostrils.  We had no idea whether they were Terran or Chtorran. There wasnt anything we could do about them anyway.  The afternoon air dripped with humidity. Our clothes refused to dry out. They stayed wet and stuck to us like clammy parasites. Everyones boots squelched with every step. And all of us were sweating.  Wed need salt tablets.  And wed need to boil water, lots of it, to avoid dehydration. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Lizard popped open cylinders of hot bullion for each of us; copilot had to help the corpsman drink, but at least he was conscious. The soup tasted more like medicine than soupprobably because it was more additives, vitamins, and antibiotics than anything elsebut it had a strong restorative effect anyway.  We were all of us beginning to feel a little better by the time the torchman and the GI returned. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I was lying just inside one of the tents, with the flaps open so I could see out.  Lizard had ordered me into it over my protests, and then shed settled down to rest just outside the entrance, watching while Kruger fiddled with the comm-link. He seemed to be having problems with it, but he was uncommunicative. Hed gone sullen again. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Lizard stood up shakily as the others approached, wiping her hands on her hips.  They were alone. Weve got food, she called, holding up a couple of bullion flasks. She was genuinely worried about them. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">The GI didnt answer. His expression told the whole story. He brushed past her to the opposite side of the camp. He crawled into the far raft-tentwhere the corpsman still sat in shockand pulled the flap shut behind him. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Lizard looked to the torchman with a question on her face. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">He grunted. He was a big man; he looked like a football player. He took one of the flasks, popped the top open and began drinking, without even waiting for the soup to heat. He drank half the contents before he lowered it. He wiped his mouth with his sleeve. We found one of his buddies, he reported. Floating face down. The river got him. Couldnt even get to him to pull him out. The kid took it bad. He nodded toward the tent. Hes real shaky. He lost his whole team, one right after the other. And hes never seen action before. So thats gotta be real rough. He sucked his teeth and spat. Hell get over it. We all do. And...at least, he has confirmation. He turned and stared out at the oppressive green wall of vegetation, searching it with his eyes one more time. My buddy just...disappeared.  </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">His buddy.  The other torchman.  The one whod appeared for just an instant, shouting,  I cant find him.  I cant find him.  Ive looked all over, I cant find him.  </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">The river stank of decay. Parts of it were shallow and sluggish, while only meters away, deeper water swept by with alarming speed. Anything or anyone caught up in the rushing current would have been swept away in an instant.  I wondered if I should say anything.  Would it help?  Would it make a difference? Wed lost the pilot, both gunners, three GIs, and one torch-bearer. Did it matter?  I didnt really feel like talking.  I was beginning to itch all over.</span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt"> What about yourself? Lizard asked. Are you okay?  She sank down to the plastic mat in front of the tent again. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">He finished the can of soup in one gulp and crushed the empty container in his hand. He tossed the can at the river and then squatted down opposite us. Im doable, he said curtly, looking at us both. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">There was something about the way he spokeI studied him carefully, but I couldnt see anything wrong. Nevertheless, his tone gave me serious hesitation. I looked to Lizard, but either she was too weak to notice, or shed noticed and was giving no sign. Thank you, Sergeant...? she said/asked. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Brickman, he said, looking from Lizard to me and back again. Everybody calls me Brick. Im a burner. One of the best. You dont have nothin to worry about. He glanced to copilot and the communications gear. How long till they pick us up? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Without looking up from his screens, Kruger shook his head. I dont know. I cant get through. All the channels are busy. I cant read anything. Its all coded. Somethings going on. I cant even get a phone line. This was the most hed said to anyone since the crash. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">But the thing keeps transmittin till someone picks up the signaldont it? Brickman asked. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Copilot grunted in confirmation. He turned his attention back to his displays. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Lizard added, Well get out. Probably tonight. At worst, tomorrow. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">The corpsman came crawling out of the other tent then. We all looked at him with open curiosity. He was a thin man. He blinked in confusion, turning around slowly, running a hand through his hair and scratching, as if trying to remember where he was and how hed gotten here. After a while, he stopped. He saw us and waved half-heartedly. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Abruptly, he remembered his job. He picked up his medkit from in front of the tent and staggered over to us with a vague expression on his face. He gave each of us a pressure injection of vitamin soup; then he looked at my leg, frowned, examined the splints, and injected more of the same local anesthetic that had let me come this far without screaming. Then he stumbled back to the other raft-tent and crawled back in. We had no idea if he had actually been conscious or just walking through the motions.  </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Lizard looked to Brickman. Do you know any first aid? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">A little, maybe. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">The corpsman could probably use some attention </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">The torchman shook his head. Best thing to do is let him sleep it off. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">No, thats <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">not</span></i>  the best thing to do, Lizard corrected. He might have suffered a concussion. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">He doesnt look all that hurt to me. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Are you a doctor? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I been in combat. I seen guys go bugfuck before. Hes not hurt. Hes just stunned. Tomorrow hell have one helluva headache, but hell be doable. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Hmf, said Lizard. Clearly, she didnt share his views. Howd <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">you</span></i> get out in one piece? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Didnt. The torchman explained, I sorta jumped. Soons we got low enough. Figured Id have a better chance. I was lucky. I guessed right. I hit the river hard though. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Can I ask you something?  I rolled up on one elbow so I could look out of the tent easier.  Do you have any trouble with kryptonite? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Thats the crunchy stuff, right?  The brick shrugged. A little ketchup, some </span></font>
<p>Tabasco, its fine. I couldnt tell if he was joking or serious.  Abruptly, his expression grew harder. We got worms nearby. I can smell em.</p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">If he could, he was a better man than Ibut I didnt want to voice any more opinions on the Chtorran ecology. They wouldnt be pretty and I didnt think theyd be popular. And I might be right. Lizard was looking directly at me; she saw it in my face. She didnt say anything either. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Listen, the brick said. All Ive got is this one torch. And its only half-full. Its pretty banged-up, but it still works. I tested it. But I dont think its gonna be enough. The wormsll come for us tonight. They like to hunt in twilight, sometimes mornings. I think we should get outta here. Lets push these raft-tents into the river. Well have a better chance. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Lizard shook her head slowly. Not yet. If we can get through,she nodded toward Krugerthey can have a chopper here in an hour. Maybe less. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Eventually. Probably. Yes, Brickman agreed. But look at the time. What if we cant get through? If I read the map right, were right in the path of the whole Chtorran column. If we get on the river, we can float downstream for a hundred klicks and then call for help. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Do you know these waters? I asked. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">No. Do you? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Thats my point. This isnt Disney World. As good as our maps areand weve got some pretty good maps in that clipboardtheres a lot they dont show.  There could be rapids, whirlpools, waterfalls, hostile tribes, panthers, water snakes, insects, crocodiles, piranhaswho knows what else? And thats only the Terran stuff. We dont know what kind of Chtorran bugs and critters are waiting downstream. Ive seen tenant swarms. We couldnt survive an attack. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Kruger glanced up from his screens. He looked hostile. Thats another question. What brought us down? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Tempting fate, I said, without thinking. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Hey! Mathewson is dead, Kruger shot back bitterly. What do you want from me? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Before I could answer, Lizard put her hand on my arm. Just answer the question, Jim. Okay? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I met her glance. She was asking me to be compassionate. We were all in this together. She was right. I shook my head sadly. I dont know what brought us down. But it was nasty. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Take a guess...? Lizard suggested. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I shrugged helplessly. Flutterbys probably. But I wouldnt bet on it. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Flutterbys? Whats that? asked Kruger. Some kind of insect? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">No. Theyre not like anything on Earth. Theyre metallic, kind of. Theyre as tough as mylar. They could probably tangle your rotors or clog your jets. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">They fly? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">They float in the wind. They like to travel in swarms, but not always. They look like long silvery ribbons, but theyre parasites. They land on cattle and suck like leeches. Then they breed. They can be pretty ugly. If it was a swarm, youd have seen it on the radar. Maybethis is just a guessmaybe we hit a few stragglers following the worms. Or maybe.... Another thought, even less appealing, struck me. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Or maybe what? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Maybe the flutterbys are attracted to machinery somehow. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">How? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I dont know. But you should see them moving through the air. They ripple in perfect sine waves. They weave through the air at incredible speeds...thirty or forty klicks. And we know that theyre attracted to certain kinds of rhythmic sounds. Anyway, thatd be my best guess. I rubbed my leg uncomfortably.  It didnt hurt, it <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">itched</span></i>.  </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">In the distance, something chirruped with a bright red sound. Brickman stood up suddenly; hed been rummaging through the P-rations. Now they lay forgotten at his feet while he listened to the echoes. We all fell silent. A dripping blanket of air lay across the afternoon. The hot sunlight scorched all colors. And the dark voice of the river blanketed the distant noises. The jungle stank of decay, but the flavor was overlaid with something pungent, sweet, and cloying. We could all taste it now. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">We cant stay here, said Brickman. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">We cant go, said Lizard. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Dont be stupid. Im the worm expert, the big man said. He spoke as if he expected no argument. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I resisted the temptation to reply with the first thing that came to mind. Instead, I took a calming breath said quietly, I appreciate your expertise. But Im not without some knowledge myself. I gave him what I hoped was my friendliest smile. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Yeah, what?  he looked skeptical.  You read the red book?  </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Um actually, I <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">wrote</span></i> the red book.  The ecological sections are mine.</span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt"> Brickman dismissed it with a curt nod.  Yeah, well, I appreciate that, fellabut you science boys could benefit from some time in the field too. Things are a lot different than out here than they are in a lab or behind a keyboard. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Ive spent time in the field, I said blandly. Ive burned my share of worms. I didnt elaborate. Brickman was young. He was probably still in middle school when I torched my first gastropede. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">He didnt look like he believed me; but he replied grudgingly, Well, then you should know how dangerous they are. We gotta get outta here now. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Um, excuse me, said Lizard, politely indicating the stars in her collar. But Im still in charge here. Im the general. She nodded toward me. That mans in no condition to be moved any farther. Our best chance is still the comm-link. If we get out there on the river, well be putting ourselves farther and farther away from help. Weve got to stay in one place if were going to have any hope of being found. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Kruger kicked at the comm-set in disgust; he pushed it away in frustration. Forget the comm-link. Its hopeless. Bricks right. Lets get out on the river. He stood up. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">No, said Lizard quietly. Thats an order. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">With all due respect, maam, the brick said. But the worms dont give a shit. Theyll eat anything. They wont care if youre a general. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I almost laughed at that. Id given the same speech myself too many times. Maybe he was right. I reached over and touched Lizards arm. Maybe we should talk about this. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Jim, she lowered her voice. She took my hand in hers and we turned away from the others. She stuck her head half into the tent to whisper to me. Theres nothing to talk about. Neither of us has the strength for the river. And the maps dont show what we most need to knowhow bad the infestation is downstream. Its too big a risk. You said that yourself. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">We dont have to go the whole length. Maybe we could just go far enough to get out of worm range </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Did you look at the map, Jim? Downriver is </span></font>
<p>Japura. Wed have to go through the worst of it before we got clear.</p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I just want to get us away from that column of horrors </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">So do I, sweetheart. But weve got to trust our own contingency plans. Please, back me up on this...? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I knew that if I pressed the point, shed give in. She trusted my judgment about the worms unconditionallyand I wanted to insist, but at that moment my knee hurt so bad that the thought of trying to move even an inch was intolerable. Maybe she was right this time. I was tired and frustrated. I wanted to trust her judgment. I wanted to let someone else be responsible. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I nodded my acceptance. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt"></span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Solomon Short</span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">When we turned back to the others, Kruger and Brickman had been joined by the sour-looking GI.  His nametag identified him as Salcido. I got the feeling he already knew Brickman, possibly Kruger. He was saying, They cant travel. If we try to get em out, well all die.  Lets leave em here. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">What about Meyer, the corpsman? Kruger asked. He could be useful. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">You wanna baby-sit him? I dont. </span></font>

<p>_<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; FONT-STYLE: italic">Nobodys leaving anybody, </span></font>_Lizard said. Because nobodys leaving. Not until were sure. She pointed toward the comm-set. Its displays were still blinking an annoying red.</p>

<p><em><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; FONT-STYLE: italic">Im</span></font></em> sure, said Kruger.</p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Listen, lady Brickman began. </span></font>

<p><em><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; FONT-STYLE: italic">General</span></font></em></p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Out here, rank dont matter none, interrupted Salcido. Youre just another fuckin mouth to feed </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Kruger hushed the GI before Lizard could respond;  Brickman continued quickly, Listen, copilot says the box is broken. We aint gettin through. They dont know were here. We gotta get out any way we can. You were trapped in the wreckage of the <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Bosch</span></i> for three days. You didnt see what the rest of us saw</span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Sergeant, please dont patronize me. I know the plans that were made. Our best chance of getting out is to stay right here. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Brickman shook his head. Lady, the whole damn thing came apart like a paper diaper. Everything. All the planning. All the organization. Everybody panicked. Nothin worked. Somebody fucked up big time and a lot of good guys died. I dont think we can trust the man or the plan anymore. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Lizard was good.  She didnt let her frustration show.  Listen, Brickman. I was flying missions before you were old enough to masturbate. I know that comm-system. It <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">cant</span></i> fail. It has multiple redundancies. Before we signed off on this mission, we ran over a hundred rescue simulations. On four of them<i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">only four</span></i>the channels temporarily overloaded; the longest was for fifteen minutes. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Theyve been out for over an hour...at least, Kruger said, checking his watch. I dont even know if they got our mayday. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">An hour? Lizard looked annoyed. Thats not right. The system <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">cant</span></i> stay down that long. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Copilot didnt answer; he just turned the box so that she could see the blinking red displays. No channels were open. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">But they <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">have </span></i>to know weve gone downwhen we fell out of the grid, we should have set off alarms from here to </span></font>
<p>Houston. She glanced at her watch. And we should have been in Yuana Moloco by now anyway, so were officially overdue. Theyre probably already out hunting for us. All they need is a signal. Any chopper within a hundred klicks will pick up our distress beacon.</p>

<p><em><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; FONT-STYLE: italic">Uh-huh</span></font></em>…. Kruger said it with deliberate emphasis.</p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Lizard looked annoyed. Whats <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">that</span></i> supposed to mean? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">If thats true, where are they all? Brickman asked. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Lizard got it the same time I did. Her eyes went wide. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">There was a string of choppers ahead of us, and another string behind us, Kruger said. One of them should have seen us go down. They all should have heard our maydays. <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Where are they?</span></i> </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Lizard couldnt answer that. She went from confusion to fear to anger so fast that I was the only one who recognized the process. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Seeheres the thing, Brickman said to us, squatting down opposite us, as if he was about to explain it to a couple of recalcitrant children. I mean, dont take it personal, but your plans and your decisionsthey just dont work anymore. I mean, weve seen it ourselves what happened and were not gonna die for you. We gotta start takin care of ourselves. Now... He indicated the others. ...Me an Jake an Lennywere goin down the river. An Im not so sure we want to take you with us. We havent made up our minds what to do with you two. No offense intended, maam, but youre a couple of cripples, an if we tried to take you with, wed be endangering our own lives. He wiped his forehead and added, Course, leavin you here aint none too fair either. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Lizard listened calmly to the whole speech without giving away any of her thoughts. Her face remained dispassionately unreadable. Are you done? she asked. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Brickman nodded. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">You havent thought this through all the way, she pointed out. Kruger and Salcido studied her skeptically. I was acutely aware how precarious our position had abruptly become. We were on a very slippery slope. I suddenly doubted that Lizard could say anything to save us. Suppose you do get out. How are you going to explain abandoning us? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">We dont explain anything at all, retorted Salcido. We never saw you. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Uh-uhgame it out. She explained. First of all, theres a hundred klicks of the thickest Chtorran infestation in the world downriver. I dont know if you saw any of Dr. McCarthys briefings She nodded in my direction. I glanced at her in surprise. Dr? but the President of the </span></font>
<p>United States considers him the worlds foremost authority on the infestation. Hes gone down into more worm nests than any other living human being, and hes collected more bounties than anyone else either. Hes burned, blown-up, and frozen more worms than your whole unit, Sergeant Brickman. And his briefings on Chtorran behavior have been made publicly available. So I suggest you listen to what he has to say about your chances downstream.</p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Brickman and the others looked at me as if seeing me for the first time. I know who he is, the torchman grunted. He aint too well-liked, I hear. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Lizard ignored it. Downstream is the Japuran mandala, the largest infestation of worms on the planet. That river goes straight through the heart of it. Now, you figure how fast this river flowsassuming there are no shallows to catch youand then you figure how many hours youll be floating through worm country. She turned to me. How long, Jim? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Brickman was frowning, trying to do the same calculations in his head as I was. I had the advantage of having studied the both the maps and the aerial photographs for months. Well... I began slowly. Theres a few places where it looks like the worms have dammed the river. Maybe for feeding, maybe for breeding, we dont know; but theyve made some pretty big lakes. The water doesnt flow directly through. You could get hung up there. And then theres at least two long patches of white water you need to be aware of. And I think theres a long stretch of marshland where the river slows down to a crawl; again, thats the result of the worms doing something, were not sure what. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I thought you said we didnt know what was downriver.  </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Well,  I smiled.  Thats the part we do know.  Im sure theres a lot more that didnt show up in the recon photos. My guess is that even with the motors, youll still spend two, maybe three, days getting past the Japuran mandala. Thats assuming the worms dont swim out to investigate. Youll look like a big sushi boat to them. I dont think theyll let you pass uninvestigated.  Theyre very curious.  And Im not even going to speculate what might be <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">in </span></i>the water.  </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Salcido and Kruger had started to lose some of their conviction, but Brickman looked unconvinced. I got my torch. He hefted the flame-thrower meaningfully. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Okay. You can be a tempura boat. Whatever you want. Worms arent fussy. Theyll even eat sergeants. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">But lets be generous, said Lizard. Lets assume you make it past the Japuran mandala. I wouldnt bet on it, but lets assume you do. You come out of the jungle a week from now, or a month, or whatever it takes, and youre still looking at a firing squad. Excuse me, <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">first</span></i> a court martial<i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">then</span></i> a firing squad. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">That wont do you no good, said Salcido. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Youre assuming that if you leave us behind, well die. Lizard grinned. I didnt tell you the last part. Dr. McCarthy here knows how to speak to the worms. Its still a military secret; hes still working on the dictionary, but he does know the Chtorran word for friend. Were getting out. I cant say the same for you if you head downriver alone. You need us. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Salcido snorted in disgust. I got an idea, he said. Lets just do em. He was already reaching for his pistol. Brickman stood up abruptly and knocked Salcido backward. He towered over the smaller man. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Dont be an asshole, he said. What if shes right? We gotta talk about this? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Whats to talk about? Theres worms in the jungle. Were gettin outta here. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Brickman shook his head. I want to look at the map again. And lets give Kruger some more time with the comm-set. He pointed. Go ahead, Jake. Try it again. Brickman grabbed Salcido by the arm and dragged him away. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I dont like this, man </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">An I dont like all your talk about doin. I dont <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">do</span></i> people. Not women, anyway </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">My mind was racing. There had to be something I could do, something to say. Time slowed down.... </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">These men were hurting. I didnt know what they had been through before they had climbed aboard the chopperit must have been horrificand we werent really certain what had set them off now. What they needed was a reason to hold themselves in check. Maybe, if they had some time to cool down...maybe they would realize</span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">No. Looking at it from their point of view, the only thing they could realize was that Lizard and I were very much a liability to them. We couldnt appeal to their honor anymore. The war had boiled away a lot of old-fashioned luxuries. Like honor and integrity.  No, I had to find another way</span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">You dont want to do it in front of witnesses, do you? I said a little too quickly.  I pulled myself up to a sitting position, half-in, half-out of the tent.  My leg twitched warningly.</span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Eh? The three of them stopped and turned to stare at me. What are you talking about. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Theres at least a half million telepaths wired into us. <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Right now</span></i>. I tapped my head meaningfully. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">For the first time, I saw real uncertainty on Salcidos face. Youre shittin me, man.  If you were a teep, youd be crazy. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">You already know how crazy I am.  Besides, its possible to be a teep and not know it. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Bullshit! Kruger turned and spat on the ground. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">The Teep corps routinely implants members of the militarymost of the time without their even knowing it. It gives them ancillary data they couldnt get any other way. Have you ever been on the table? Then you probably have an implant? If you dont believe me, ask her. I nodded toward Lizard. Shell tell you. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Lizards eyes were full of pain and tears. She glanced downward as if looking at some private shame, then met my eyes again.  I was going to have to ask her about this later.  Yes, she said. Its true. There are over a hundred thousand involuntaries in the service.  The corps uses them for intelligence and for monitoring gastropede behavior.  The services have gained a lot of useful information that way, especially from people who didnt make it back to report.  Most of them never find out </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Is <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">he </span></i>a teep? Brickman jerked a thumb at me. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Wordlessly, she nodded and swallowed hard. Since day one. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Yeah, well, if its such a secret, Salcido interrupted. How come he knows? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Its not too hard to figure out, I said.  You hear voices, you get hallucinations, weird dreams, all kinds of shit that makes you think youre crazier than everybody else. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Brickman scratched his head, considering.  He glanced from me to Salcido, to Kruger, and back to Lizard. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I grinned at him and added, And...think about this. Theres just as good a chance that one of you might be a teep too. Can you take that chance? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I aint convinced, said Salcido, reaching for his gun again. He pushed up close to Brickman. Listen to me. The rescue beam aint gettin through, right?  Then neither is he </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">The teep corps uses a different satellite system, I said. I didnt know if that was true or not, but if I didnt know, then I was betting that neither did he. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Well then, youre lyin about bein a teep, Salcido said to me. He turned back to Brickman. Don t you see? Hes tryin to psych us. If he were a teep, then theyd know we were down and theyd know where we were down and theyd have had a chopper here already </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Wrong. Twice over. First, the teep corps never interferes with involuntariesthey hardly even rescue their own people. Second, whatever knocked us down is probably knocking other choppers down as well, and the service is probably busy picking up people all over the whole damn river. And if the teep corps is monitoring us, then they know were not in any immediate danger; they can see were okay for the moment, so our pickup probably isnt the highest priority right now. But Ill tell you this I stared directly into his hollow dead eyes. If you do us, youll be court-martialed. Count on it. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Who says were goin back? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Youll still be on the run for the rest of your life. Youll never know whos a teep and who isnt. And youll never be able to sleep securely again. Do you know what kind of assassinations the Teep corps does? They find out who or what you like to fuck. And then one night, while youre just lying there all fat and happy and satisfied, just drifting in the land of afterward, your sweet little girl friend or boy friend or whatever rolls over and slides a sharp steel knife across your throat. Do you really think youll ever be able to relax again with the Teep corps after you? Youll certainly never feel safe in bed. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Actually, Jim, Lizard said, The Teep corps doesnt even have to bother with an assassin. If theyve implanted you, and if you commit an act of felony murder, theyll just pull the plug on the main switchboard. The implant will self-destructand so will the person wearing it. Ive never seen it myself, but Im told its a particularly nasty and painful way to die. A brain seizure. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Salcido didnt answer. He couldnt. Whatever he was thinking about, it remained a mystery behind his sallow brooding features. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Kruger resolved it. Aaah, shit, he said, dismissing us all with a sharp arm gesture. He turned and trudged away across the sand. He squatted down with the comm-set again, ignoring us both. Salcido looked from him to Brickman, shook his head and reslung his rifle over his shoulder. This aint over, he said. He turned away too, walking away down the river. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Brickman stood for a moment longer, staring at me, studying; trying to figure out if Id been telling the truth or if it had all been a colossal lie. I kept my face impassive, met his gaze, just allowed myself to <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">be</span></i>...without anything else going on. Its a thing we learned in the Mode training. <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Being</span></i> without adding anything to it. It sort of makes you look like a zombie or a zone-head. It can be very disconcerting to those who dont understand. I was betting that Brickman didnt. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">He grunted and nodded almost imperceptibly, the barest possible indication of his grudging respect. Then he moved off after Salcido. I had no idea what they were going to talk about. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">We were alive...for the moment. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Lizard and I looked at each other like two haggard old warriors. For a moment, I almost didnt recognize her. She looked like shed been hammered. How far had we come in just the past three days? Light years, it seemed. Her face was gray and lined. Her eyes were shining with held-back tears. We were both of us physically exhausted and emotionally drained. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I started to reach for her, but she waved me away. Her emotions were unreadable. Somehow, she managed to point toward the inside of the tent. I rolled out of her way and she climbed clumsily in to join me. She pulled the tent flaps shut and collapsed sobbing into my arms. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Scared shitless. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">You were great. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">So were you. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Yeah, that reminds me. When did I become a doctor? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">As soon as we get back, Ill arrange it with UCLA. Youre overdue for validation. Ph.D. good enough? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Theres no one there whos qualified to judge me. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Thats my point, sweetheart. Youre <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">long</span></i> overdue for some heavyweight credentials. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Lizard looked haggard. Her auburn hair hung down in uneven wet strings. Her shirt was soaked under both arms. She smelled almost as bad as me. I didnt care. I just wanted her close. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Were in deep shit, she said. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Yep, I agreed. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Were about as far up the Amazon as you can get </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Without a paddle, I agreed. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">But you did good, she whispered. That was a very scary picture you painted. I knew I could count on you to make up something horrifying. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I wasnt making it up, I said. That was all the truth. If anything, I understated it. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">We fell silent then. For a few moments, we rested together, simply appreciating the physical closeness of each others body. She felt so good to menot because she was a beautiful woman, but because she was someone familiar and safe. I put my hand on her shoulder and cradled my head against her breast. She stroked my hair and cooed softly, reassuringly. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">You know, I lost my pistol in the crash, she said. If they decide to come for us </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I know, I said. But I cant think of anything else. That teep story was my best shot. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">It was good, she admitted after a nervous moment. I had trouble keeping a straight face. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">You did great, I said. You looked as if you <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">almost </span></i>believed me when I said it. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">For a moment, I did. You were very convincing. I was wondering myself how you found out </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I made it up, I said. It was a <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">gimtree</span></i>. Im not really a teep. And then suddenly, the horrifying thought came ricocheting home, and the corresponding chill came rocketing up my spine.  I saw the panic on her face. Oh, Godtell me the truth, Lizard. Im <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">not </span></i>a telepath...<i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">am I? </span></i></span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">No, she said flatly. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Something about the look in her eyes and the way she said it. I dont believe you. I couldnt believe Id just said that to her. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Jim, she said. Youre <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">not</span></i> a telepath. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Then why do I keep thinking that youre lying to me? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Umouch, that hurtsprobably because Ive lied to you so many times before. Jim, if you love me, youll believe me on this one. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">want </span></i>to believe you, Lizard... She met my eyes impassively; I shook my head in confusion. This is crazy. I admitted. My paranoia is showing again, isnt it? I stared into her sad eyes. Maybe it was done without your knowledge? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">It wasnt, she said flatly. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">How can you be so sure? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Jim. Im your commanding officer. If you were a telepath, <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Id </span></i>know. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Who else would know? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Well...Uncle Ira would know for sure. Maybe Danny Anderson. That would probably be it. At least, in our chain of command. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">General Wainwrong? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">No, he wouldnt have access to that part of your file. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I sank back onto the mat. Stared at the dark material of the tent for a while. Im really crazy then, arent I? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Everybodys crazy, she said automatically. Everybody said it. It was the mantra. The international excuse. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">No, I corrected. I really mean it. For a while there, I was hoping youd tell me that I <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">am</span></i> a telepath. If I really were, then maybe it would explain all the crazy stuff thats going on in my head. The voices, the strange dreams, the weird memories. Like...I remember parts of </span></font>
<p>Disneyland that they never built. How can I do that? I remember places Ive never seen. I remember dying in a feeding frenzy of shambler tenants. How can I remember <em>dying?</em> If I were a telepath, at least Id have an explanation for everything. Id know Im not losing it.</p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">She reached over and patted my hand. Its all right, sweetheart. I know what it is. Youre not alone. A lot of people have it. Its aa syndrome. It isnt even named yet. We just call it <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">the syndrome</span></i>. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">A syndrome? Thats a convenient word. You can use it to explain away just about anything you want. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Well, we dont want to scare anyone. People already have enough to be afraid of. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Go ahead, I said. Scare me. It couldnt be worse than <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">not</span></i> knowing. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">She took a breath. She met my gaze directly. Okay. It hasnt been officially announced yet, but were going to call it Chtorran Hallucinogenic Acquired Observation Syndrome, she explained. It happens to people whove spent too much time exposed to the Chtorran ecology. Like yourself. Youve been in Chtorran nests, youve eaten Chtorran foods, youve been exposed to a lot of Chtorran hallucinogens. Some of that stuff stays with younot simply as chemicals in the body, which we know will break down after a while, but also as <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">experiences</span></i>. Youve got new channels in your thinking, Jim. Non-terrestrial channels. Your mind cant assimilate all the non-human experiences. It has no referents, so they manifest themselves as hallucinations and weird dreams and strange emotions and feelings. Id be surprised if you <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">didnt</span></i> have CHAOS. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Chaos? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">C. H. A. O. S.  Chtorran Hallucinogenic Acquired Observation Syndrome. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Oh.  Cute, I admitted. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">She rolled closer to me, carefully so as not to brush my battered knee. She put her hands gently on my chest. If anyones got it, then youve probably got the worst case of it in the world, she said. We were going to talk to you about it when we got backonly now, I dont know when well ever get back. But...anyway, see heres the thing. Im beginning to think that the syndrome might be part of the reason you.... She trailed off into silence. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Part of the reason I <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">what?</span></i> </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">She sighed. Her voice ached. ...I think maybe thats part of the reason youve been losing your temper so much. I mean, yes, part of it is your personality...but I remember you as a very serious little boy. I thought you were cute. Remember? You used to simmer a lot, but you never exploded. At least, not like recently.  Now...well, I dont know.  She hesitated.  Maybe Im just sensitized to your moods more now because I love you so much. But maybe its also something we should check when we get back...? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I couldnt answer her. My head felt blurry. I was feeling six different emotions at once. Gratitude, horror, panic, relief, hope, and a very real need to just hold onto her and cry as hard as I could. Instead, I did nothing. Just waited for some of the feelings to pass. Couldnt even look at them to see what they were. Or why. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Jim? she asked worriedly. She brushed my hair back. Are you all right? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I dont know, I said. Its all too much. It was hard to say even that much. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Im sorry, she said. I didnt want to hurt you. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Dont be. I asked you to tell me. Besides...nothing would make me happier than to know that some of this craziness isnt really mine, its only borrowed. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">She lowered her head gently to my chest. I almost wish I <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">could</span></i> tell you that you were a telepath, she whispered softly. If it would ease your mind. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I dunno, I said. I'm not sure anything could ease my mind anymore. I managed to get one aching arm around her shoulders. Her jacket was stiff and matted with mud. I didnt care. For a long while, neither one of us said anything. We both stank of dirt and blood and the river. I hurt all over, I was sure that she did too. I was exhausted and terrified and my heart was pounding in my chest. My throat hurt. I could barely swallow. I wondered if either of us would survive the night. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Hey? Lizard asked abruptly. Whats a <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">gimtree</span></i>? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Dont you know? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Its your word. Not mine. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">It was named after the famous American flim-flam man, I said. Elmer Gimtree. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">She phrased her next words carefully, Before you go on, I feel I should remind you that the perfect pun always results in the death of the perpetrator. Youre on dangerous ground here. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Im not scared.  A good pun is its own reword.  </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Uh-huh.  And the beauty of a pun is in the <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">oy</span></i> of the beholder.  </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">And the shortest distance between two puns</span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt"><i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">is a straight line</span>! </i> we both finished together.  </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">That one deserves a bullet surprise,  I annotated.  </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I think I liked the limericks better,  she said.  Puns are like farts.  I dont mind you enjoying your own, but you really dont have to share the experience.  Now whos Elmer Gimtree?  </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">You honestly dont know? I asked in mock-surprise, facing her directly. Elmer Gimtree was world-famous for making up the most outrageous stories on the spur of the moment. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Never heard of him, she said. She raised herself up on one elbow, she raised one eyebrow expectantly. This had better be good, McCarthy. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Elmer Gimtree was my dads alter-ego, I explained. Whenever we asked him a question, he always made up a weird story. Like once when I was 8 or 9, I asked him what all the weird buttons were on the dashboard of the car. Without missing a beat, he started explaining them. This one is the passenger ejector seat button. This one fires the machine guns. This one activates the anti-vehicular missile defense. And this one leaves an oil-slick for pursuing cars to skid out on. And my sister and I would always try to trip him up. Id ask, How come you dont have a button for the grinder that comes out of the axle and slices up the tires of the car next to you? And hed always have an answer. Hed say something like, Oh, that cost too much extra or something like that. So a gimtree is any really great, really silly story. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">And this is the man I want for the father of my baby? she asked dryly. But why do you call it a gimtree? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Because once I asked him why the drink he was drinking was called a vodka gimlet...and he said it was made with vodka and gimberries.  And the gimberries </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">...come from the <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">gimtree</span></i>.  I got it. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">So from that time on, all his stories were gimtrees. And he was Elmer Gimtree, the storyteller. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I love it, she said. Your family must have been crazy. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">We werent certifiable, I said. But we did have our moments. Not having a sense of shame has a lot to do with it.  Once...on Thanksgiving, we had at least a dozen guestsand my mom dropped the turkey.  She started to cry.  Dad got up from the table, helped her put it back on the platter, and told her to take it back into the kitchen and get the <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">other</span></i> turkey.  He was fast that way.  He was amazing sometimes. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">She smiled silently. And I didnt add anything else. I was remembering some of the other stuff, some of the stuff that hadnt been as much fun. I couldnt blame my parents for their mistakes. Everybody figures out how to be a parent in their own turn; everybody tries not to repeat the mistakes their own parents made, and in the process they make new ones. Id probably do the same when our baby was born. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">If we got out of here. If... </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Lizard reached over and touched me.  Are you okay, Jim?</span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Yeah.  And then, I added.  Youre not going to believe thisIm thinking of chili.  </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Chili?  She looked at me incredulously.  Were in the middle of the Amazon jungle, surrounded by carnivorous caterpillars from outer space<i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">and youre thinking about food?</span></i></span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Not food.  Chili.  Really awful chili.  Remember that place in </span></font>
<p>California…The World’s Worst Chili!</p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt"><i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Oh, God, yes!  </span></i>Sasha Miller's Dreadful Chili.  Lizard rolled over on her back, laughing.  That was the <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">worst</span></i> meal I ever had in my entire life. Id rather be here than there.  </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Thats why I was thinking about it.  I was asking myself what could be worse than this?  And thats what popped into my head.  Sasha Millers chili.</span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Ick.  Lizard made a face.  I wish you hadnt reminded me.  Now Ive got that awful taste in my mouth again.</span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Im sorry.  Boy, Ill be apologizing for that one for the rest of my life.</span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">You could have plastered a house with that crap  Lizard groaned.  No self-respecting cockroach would touch it.  </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Remember the TV commercials?  The dumpy woman with the frizzy orange hair tossing weird things into a bubbling cauldrona box of cigars, a bicycle tire, a modem, a paperback novel, a bucket of millipedes, a dead cat, you name it.  </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">And then shed cackle into the camera and shed say  Lizards voice went into a gravelly imitation:  Are you man enough to eat my chili?'  </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">And theyd show her pouring it into the fuel tank of a space shuttle.  We were both laughing now.  I thought it was all a gimmick that she advertised it as the worlds worst chilibut it really <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">was.</span></i>   </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Lizard rolled on her side to smile at me.  I know why you took me there, Jim.  So Id stop complaining about your cooking. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">It worked. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I was sick for a week,  she said.</span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">You <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">farted </span></i>for a week.  </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I never had chili with maraschino cherries in it before.  Whatever happened to Sasha Miller anyway?</span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">You didn't hear?  </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">No, what?</span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I clutched my side painfully.  It hurt to laugh, but I couldnt help myself.  I'm sorry, I shouldn't be giggling like this, it really was tragic, but it was her own damn pigheaded fault.  She went to </span></font>
<p>Denver to make a commercial with one of the tame Chtorrans they had there.  Well, not really tame, but you know.  I dont know how she and her crew got in;  they must have bribed someone.  Anyway, she was there standing next to the worm, holding up a big bowl of her chili saying,  My chili makes Chtorrans purr.’  And then she offered it to the wormshe’d been warned not towell, that Chtorran purred all right, but it wasn’t about the chili.  Copies of that video were all over the net for days.  If they could have figured out how to use that as a commercial, Im sure they would have.  I levered up on an elbow, still smiling.  Okaywhats so funny?</p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Her expression was abruptly deadpan with wide-eyed curiosity.  Did the worm fart much?</span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">It died,  I said.</span></font>

<p><em><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; FONT-STYLE: italic">It died?  </span></font></em></p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Choked to death trying to get her all down.  </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">That was too much.  Lizard burst out laughing.  Im sorryI cant help it.  </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Neither could I.  We were giddy with our own hysteria.  It was everything all at once.  You can only be frightened for so long and thenyou cant.  Its all right, I said around my own cackles.  There were so many jokes about Sashas chilithis was just the best one of all.  I cant believe you didnt hear about it.  That chili really was a fatal distraction.  </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Lizard held up a hand to stop me.  No more.  No more.  I <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">really am </span></i>starting to remember what that stuff tasted like.  Ick.  Im going to start farting any minute now. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">You win,  I said quickly.</span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Let's talk about real food instead.</span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Okay chocolate  </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Chocolate?Oh, you bastard!  You would!  Torment me, why dont you?   <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Ooh, I want some chocolate now.  </span></i>Just the sound of the word is delicious.  She licked her lips luxuriously.  Mmmm.  Remember that feast on the <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Bosch...</span></i>?  Oh, what a wedding night that was.  Marry me again, Jim.  Just for the chocolate.  </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">My mouth was already watering.  I was suddenly uncomfortable.  This is not a good idea, Lizard.  Talking about food like this.</span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Yes, it is.  Say chocolate again.  Please?  <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Please, Jim?</span></i>  </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I swallowed hard.  <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate.  </span></i></span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">God, I <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">love </span></i>it when you talk dirty.   Abruptly, she rolled into my arms and held me as tightly as she could.  Hold me close and talk about chocolate, Jim!  Please!  </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Dark chocolate,  I whispered into her beautiful left ear.  So dark it hurts.  So smooth and soft, you can swim in it forever.  Poured over sweet rich treasures.  Luscious sweet caramel. Everlasting buttercream.  And truffles so rich, even the smell is intoxicating.  <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Chocolate...all the chocolate in the world.  </span></i>Chocolate raspberry truffle.  Double double chocolate fudge swirl.  </span></font>
<p>Black forest chocolate-cherry delight.  <em>Chocolate….</em>  She sobbed into my shirt, clutching it between her fingers.  I stopped talking then and just held her close, stroking her back like a baby.  After a bit, I felt her relax.  I knew the signal.  She was getting herself ready to be Lizard again.  General Tirelli. </p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I cleared my throat gently.  It still hurt.  So how bad is the syndrome? I asked.  How bad does it get? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">You saw Guyer. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Yeah, but...he was <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">living </span></i>in the camp.  That poor bastard had been hyper-assaulted by Chtorran organisms.  Do you think he could ever be normal again?  Could he recover if he were returned to an Earth-normal environment? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Nobody knows, she whispered. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">God... I said. I hope I never get like that. I cant even begin to imagine itbeing so far off the deep end that you cant even tell. Sweetheart I shifted slightly so I could look into her troubled eyes. If I ever end up like that, if theres no hope of recovery...I want to be euthanized. I dont want to be a freak. Promise me? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">She didnt answer. I knew she was still awake. And I was sure I knew why she wasnt answering. Because it was a very real possibility that I <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">might</span></i> end up like Guyer. Dr. John Guyer. Harvard Research Tribe.... </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Jim, she said. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">What? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">You once told me to never give up hope. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Youre right. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Are you changing your commitment? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">To you? Never. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">She didnt answer that. She rolled away for a moment, onto her back. She stared up at the top of the tent. I realized I had no idea at all what she was thinking about, but whatever it was, I could see in her eyes how deeply it troubled her. Share it, I whispered. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Trust me, Jim. I cant. Not yet. When we get to Luna, maybe </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Id seen her like this beforetwice. Each time, it had been a crisis of enormous self-doubt. Each time I worried that shed hold it in until she imploded. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Are you scared about the baby? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Im scared about everything. She angled her head around to glance out the tent flap. There was nothing to see. She rolled over on her stomach and edged forward, lifting one of the flaps to give herself a better view. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I reached over and stroked her hair. It was matted and stringy. I didnt care. I dont think theyre going to do it, I said. If they were, theyd have done it already. I think we scared them pretty badly. Lizard took my hand, she squeezed it hard in hers. Our conversation was punctuated with little moments of affection, secret connections of hands and eyes. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Maybe they just have to work up their courage... </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">No, I dont think so. These arent bad men. Theyre just scared. Terrified. Theyre looking for someone or something to hurt back. Thats all. When they calm down, theyll have to realize.... </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">She stopped me with a wry smile. Thats what you want to believe, isnt it? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Desperately, I admitted, answering her smile with one of my own. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">She began nervously twisting a button on my shirt. When she spoke again, it was in that little girl voice she used when she was most frightened. I keep thinking of Nicholas and Alexandra. They didnt believe their captors would hurt them either. What if this is our last night together, Jim? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I didnt have anything to say to that. This conversation was suddenly too painfulbecause there wasnt anything I could do to change the situation. I fell back in despair and studied the roof of the tent with her. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">If this really is our last night of life, I began slowly. Lets not waste it. Lets fill another cup of happiness. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I dont know if I can she choked on her words. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Try, I insisted, rolling over to face her again. What makes you happy?  More chocolate? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">She shook her head silently, with just the barest brushing of her crimson hair against my cheek. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I waited. I stroked her neck. I put my hand on the hollow place below her throat, it was painfully smooth. I let my fingers trace their way up to her cheek. It was wet. I wiped the tears away with my thumb. Go on, I said. <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">That </span></i>onesay it. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Mrs. McCarthy... she whispered, almost with embarrassment. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I like the sound of that, I agreed. It gives me a heart-on. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">A hard-on? Here? Now? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">No. A <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">heart-on. </span></i>Thats when your heart is so happy, you can feel it all over. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Oh, she said, getting it. Thats nice. I like that. Then she added, I like being a wife again. I like <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">belonging</span></i> to someone. I like being your wife. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Mm. Ive never been a wife. I hope its as nice as being a husband. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Its funny... She pulled back to look at me in the darkness. She ran her fingers gently through my hair. I never thought Id ever get married again. And I certainly didnt imagine when we started out </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Me neither... </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">But Im glad. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">So am I. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Here, she said. Lets get comfortable... </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">am </span></i>comfortable </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Shh. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">My dear wife pushed me back down so she could pull the mylar heating-blanket over both of us. Then she curled up next to me again, as close as she could without hurting my leg. Right now, she said softly, All I want to do is lay here next to you, holding you tight with the covers pulled up over our heads. Lets pretend were only seven years old and were camping out in the back yard, whispering silly secrets, and the whole rest of the world just doesnt exist anymore.  Okay?  Please? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I murmured assent. I knew what she was really asking. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Maybe the worms would find us. Maybe Salcido or Kruger would kill us for our share of the suppliesor just to keep us quiet. In the face of such uncertainty, there was nothing else we could do but have our honeymoon. We needed each others strength. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Painfully, I turned on my side to face her. I love you, sweetheart,  I said.  More than life itself. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">And I love you too. More than you know. She kissed me gently. Deliciously. It was a curious moment for both of us. We were so in love with each otherand sex had nothing to do with it at all. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I was so worried about you, she said. The whole time I was trapped in the wreckage of the <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Bosch</span></i>, all I could think of was you and what you must have been going through, not knowing and all. I felt so awful. And then... her voice cracked, ...and then, after all that time waiting, I heard noises. At first, I thought it was rescuers, I <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">prayed</span></i> that it was, but then I realized it was aa worm. She stopped abruptly. Her throat was too tight for her to continue. She started shaking. The memories were too real, too painful for her to revisit. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I held her delicately in my arms and waited patiently while she sobbed into my chest. I stroked her hair. Its all right, I said. You dont have to.... </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">No, I do, she insisted, weakly. You have to know. I want you to hear this. She found her voice again, a hoarse whisper now. I was so scared. I thought I was going to die. And then I remembered the promiseremember the promise that I asked you to make? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I nodded uncomfortably, holding her close. In the darkness, my unshaven cheek brushed roughly against the smooth skin of her neck. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">It wasnt enough. She had to hear me say it aloud. <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Remember</span></i>, Jim? Her voice was intense. Her fingers clutched my shirt, bunching up the fabric in a painful knot. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I remember, I said, not remembering at allwe had made so many promises to each other. I wondered where this conversation was heading. I wished we could just lie still instead. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">But, no. This was too important to her. I asked you to promise me that youd never let me be eaten by a worm she reminded desperately. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Oh. <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">That</span></i> promise. It had been an easy one to make. Id never believed Id ever have to keep it. Wed come so very far in such a short time. Now I wondered how Id be able to keep it without even a stick to throw at a worm. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">While I was trapped there in that wreckage, I knew that you werent going to save me. I could hear this big worm making those horrible churpling noises, chewing its way through the walls. It was pulling everything apart, looking for things to eat. I knew it was going to find me and kill me<i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">I knew it, Jim</span></i>and I knew that youd never forgive yourself afterward for not being able to keep your promise. And thats when I knew I had to find a way to live, because I had to tell you I was wrong to ask you to promise such a thing. Because it wasnt fair. She clutched me hard. Her eyes bored deep into mine. You have to make me a new promise, Jim. A better one </span></font>

<p><em><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; FONT-STYLE: italic">Anything</span></font></em>, my love. Anything you want.</p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">No, listen. She sounded frantic now. Promise me this. Whatever happens<i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">whatever</span></i>promise me that youll forgive yourself afterwards. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I dont understand...what youre asking. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Promise me that youll forgive yourself. Thats all. Please? She sounded desperate. Her fingers dug into my arm. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I tried to pull her closer, tried to comfort her. I tried to sound as sincere as I could, even though I still didnt get it. I promise, I said. You can count on me. No matter what happens, Ill apologize to me as best as I can, and then Ill forgive myself. Okay? I didnt know if I sounded sincere or silly. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Jim, <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">please! </span></i></span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Too silly. I tried again. Cross my heart and hope to die. I felt exactly like a seven year old. What else could I say to her? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Stick a noodle in your eye...? she asked. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I think thats supposed to be <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">needle</span></i>. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Yes, I know, she whispered softly, but I dont want you hurting yourself. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Lover, I promise you. I wont hurt myself. And Ill keep my promise. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">She relaxed in my arms. Good, she said. At last, she sounded satisfied. Thank you. She sighed and snuggled up safely again, making little moaning sounds of comfort. She changed the subject incongruously. This isnt exactly the honeymoon wed planned, but Im happy. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Me too.</span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">She added abruptly, I couldnt believe it when the prowler appeared. It was just like the cavalry coming over the hill. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">You dont know how close it was </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Shh, she said. Lets rest now. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Mmm, I agreed. I was having trouble keeping up with her mercurial shifts of conversation. I began to wonder how much of the syndrome she was demonstrating.... </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">For a while, neither of us said anything. We listened to the sounds of the smothering Amazon night. Outside the tent, the river whispered to itself; repeating its own fetid stories of malignancies and death. Alien creatures swam in its watersfrom the smallest microbes to the largest carnivores. Red and black plants crept unseen along the river bottoms, providing food and shelter to a million voracious little feeders and breeders. They were spreading up the tributaries and down toward the deltas. Other animals would follow themstrange new formsfeeding and breeding; the next links in the food chain would also follow the path of the river, one after the other, spreading crimson death like a pollutant. The colonization of Earth was going on all around us. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Above us, the trees shook their branches uncomfortably, as if trying to rid themselves of all the <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">wrong</span></i> creatures that crept along their limbs, gnawing at their leaves, nesting in their blossoms, and burrowing under their deep dark skins. My imagination painted horrible pictures. Strange purple fungi crept up along thick trunks, bleeding the nourishment out of the wood, smothering the jungle one tree at a time. Heavy red and black vines draped themselves over the branches, leaching nourishment out of the soil, growing larger and thicker until eventually they toppled their hosts. Millipedes chewed tunnels into the roots. Nematodes drilled into the flesh of the trees, leaving narrow writhing holes through which other, more malicious, creatures could enter. Tenant swarms built cancerous-looking nests, bulging out like grotesque goiters in the joints. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">High above in the canopy, carnivorous red veils stretched themselves across the leaves like awnings; like hungry spider-webs, they captured and ate every living creature that unwittingly caught itself in their sticky threads. Other feeders opened huge blossoms to the night, releasing ferocious odors that spread for kilometers on the wind, attracting all manner of flying beasts and bugs, both native and Chtorran. Huddled in the nest of our fragile tent, the smells assaulted us. Ever-changing, alternately attractive and appalling, the odors of the night kept dragging us back to terrified wakefulness. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">We lay together and let the sounds whisper to us. The steady buzz of insects made a background hum that sounded like old-fashioned high-tension wires. No other noises were audibleno birds or frogs or other beasts. Not even any purple-red shrieks in the distance. That was ominous. Once or twice, we even stuck our heads out of the tent to peer around. But if there was anyone around, we didnt see them or hear them. Nothing. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Solomon Short</span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I woke up suddenly. Something was wrong. Hot sunlight streamed in through the open flap of the tent. I was sure we had pinned it shut. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I tried to move. I ached all over. I turned painfully to look at Lizard. She was still asleep. She shifted herself, turning slightly toward me; she had a faint smile on her face. Despite her dirt and injuries, she was still the most beautiful woman I had ever awakened with.  She looked surprisingly relaxed and untroubledand for a moment, I hesitated, wondering whether I should disturb her or not. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Outside, the morning was unnervingly quiet. Even the river seemed hushed. That was what had startled me awake. The silence. </span></font>

<p><em><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; FONT-STYLE: italic">Lizard...</span></font></em> I whispered. I nudged her gently. <em>Sweetheart, wake up</em></p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I left it in the bedroom she mumbled. </span></font>

<p><em><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; FONT-STYLE: italic">Lizard, shhh. Its all right. Wake up </span></font></em></p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Hmm? Huh? What...? She blinked in confusion, rubbing her eyes. What happened? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I placed a finger across her lips. <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Shhh </span></i>Her eyes widened. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Slowly, quietly, I pulled the rest of the blanket off. I rolled over and inched my way toward the open flap of the tent. I peeked carefully out. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">There was nothing there. Just daylight, the river, the stink, and the incessant haze of gnat-like bugs. The soft rustle of the water played against the louder drone of the insects in the foliage. I glanced back to Lizard. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">What? she said. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">False alarm, I admitted. I felt embarrassed and stupid. I guess Im not used to waking up in the jungle. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">You scared the hell out of me, she said, sitting up, brushing her hair back. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Sorry, I said. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Aack, she said. I feel like a camel has been sleeping in my mouth. Oh, ick. She made a face, as if she was tasting something awful; then stopped abruptly to look at me with concern. How do <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">you </span></i>feel? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Ive been better, I admitted. I worked my arms and neck. I was sore all over. I tested my leg. It still hurt. I can get to the river, if thats what you mean. We can launch this raft. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">She didnt look like she believed me. First, lets try the comm-link. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">The comm-link</span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Thats what I had missed. I looked back outside the tent. The comm-set was <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">gone. </span></i></span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Jim, what is it? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Those cowards. Those <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">stupid</span></i> little bastards. They took the communications gear with them. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">What?! She was already climbing toward the opening of the tent, yanking back the flap and pushing her way out. I followed painfully after her, half-hobbling, half-crawling. Lizard stood up slowly, swearing profusely. She was showing a lot more strength than yesterday. She was using words from languages I didnt recognize.  And the balloons are gone!  They cut the tether!  Theyd left us with nothing but our tent and the few supplies wed tossed into it.  </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Lizard turned around in circles, staring at the ground, at the broken campfire and the scattering footprints all around. I grabbed a stick and levered myself to my feet. My leg <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">twinged</span></i>, but I managed. Its amazing what you can do when youre pissed off. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I saw it before she did</span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Across from the tent. Him. It. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">In the wall of jungle.  Foliage dense and dark.  Black and blue, streaked with red and orange.  </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Eyes.  Bright and scary. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">It sat deep in shadow, motionless in a dark cave of greenery, sheltered by the close canopy of vegetation.  It looked like a clutch of driftwood on the sand;  skinny, gnarled, brown and twisted; sitting cross-legged, arms folded across its belly, rocking like an autistic child, crooning softly. Its eyes were vacant, but I had the strangest feeling that it was watching us intently, that it could see us as vividly as the burning sun above. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Beside me, Lizards voice trailed off in mid-sentence. She saw the creature too. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">For a moment, we just stared at it. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">In the blistering Amazon morning, it looked like a hallucination. Leathery-skin, etched with tiny tracksas if something determined and voracious had burrowed its way under the flesh and chewed itself a network of subcutaneous avenues, back and forth, up and down, over and around, leaving as evidence of its passage, an intricate pattern of furrows and ridges limning and outlining every muscle and bone and bend of body, marking the body like a terraced field. The arms and legs, the back and belly, the face and neckeven up to the ears and across the scalpall were covered with an elaborate design of scar-lines. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">A banner of almost-luminous, almost-transparent, almost-feathery quills rose brightly from the creatures naked skull. Starting small at the center of its forehead, rising steadily in height as they progressed toward the crownlike a peacocks headdressthey floated in the air, quivering like antennae. He raised his head then, the barest of motions, and looked across at us. His eyes lost their vacant look, they filled with recognition. </span></font>

<p><em><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; FONT-STYLE: italic">Shiny...</span></font></em> he said, looking straight at me.</p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Oh, my God I recognized him. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">What? <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">What is it?</span></i> Lizard whispered. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">The apparition shifted its gaze to her. She flinched visibly. She put her hand to her mouth to keep herself from screaming. The thing had been human once. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Its Guyer, I said, feeling a chill, even in the aching heat of the morning. Dr. John Guyer. Harvard Research </span></font>
<p>Mission. He must have escaped in the crash of the <em>Bosch</em>.</p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I thought he was evacuated. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Me too I swallowed my fear and hobbled a few steps toward him. John? I asked. John Guyer? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">His eyes focused, and for a moment, I was staring into an alien intelligencefor just that moment, I felt as if I were finally face to face with someone or some<i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">thing</span></i> capable of explaining to me who or <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">what</span></i> the Chtorr really was. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Dr. Guyer? I remembered the last time I tried to talk to him. Hed called me <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">shiny</span></i> then too. Hed lived with the Chtorrans for ten months and this was what hed turned intoa gibbering madman. The last time Id tried to speak with him, hed been so mercurial of mood, sliding from one bizarre affect to anothersometimes even in mid-sentenceit was like a conversation with a one-man bedlam. Id come away with the feeling that Id been talking to three or four separate personalities all competing for control of the same body. And yet...at the same time, Id also gotten the sense that Dr. Guyer was still in there, screaming to get out, desperately wanting to tell meor <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">anyone</span></i>what was happening. Or maybe that was just my imagination, maybe that was just what I wanted to believe. Dr. Guyer? Its me. Jim McCarthy. Remember? We spoke before. On the dirigible? You called me <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">shiny</span></i>. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I didnt know if he heard me. He simply squatted and studied me without reaction for the longest time. I felt Lizards hand on my arm. Her fingers clutched. Then...Guyer began unfolding himself slowly and her grip tightened even more. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">He was a stick man, all bone and lanky-gristle. He moved with a terrible slow gracelike a human mantis. He rose up to a standing position, not like one climbing into place as Lizard or I would have done it; rather, he seemed to <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">float</span></i> erect. He glided out of the darkness toward us</span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">In the sunlight, he blazed with color. He was etched with it. He glistened like a stained glass window. It was as if the light came <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">through</span></i> him. He glowed red and pink and orange and white. He moved in a nimbus of spidery fluorescence. He was bathed in furit wasnt as thick as the fur which grew on the worms, but it had the same micro-strand silkiness. The light bounced and shattered; it danced around him. He sparkled.  He looked like angel and demon, both at the same time. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">The red and pink quills on his head glistened;  the line of spidery growths led across the crown and down the back of his head, ultimately becoming a trace of bright feathery patches that followed the ridge of his spine all the way down his back. Now, we could see that he had more patches of quills elsewhere on his body; around his wrists and ankles, like fuzzy bracelets and anklets; more thick tufts of quills under his arms; and even more protruded from the crack of his buttocks. The effect was ludicrous. Had he not been so grotesque, he would have looked like a Chtorran rooster. I wondered how he sat or sleptor copulatedwith all those feathers in the way. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">As if he were reading my thoughts, Guyer threw his head back and emitted a heart-rending, ear-scraping, throat-ripping howl. He flapped his arms like wings and leapt up into the air, shouting and crowingC<i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">rrkl-drrkl-drr!</span></i><i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic"> </span></i> Only the way he sang it, it came out like something a Chtorran might say. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Dr. Guyer? Can you hear me? Can you understand me? Its terribly important. General Tirelli and I have both been injured. We need help. We need to get out of the jungle. We need to get away from here. Please? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Guyers eyes flickered. He held out his hands, first to Lizard, then to me, as if looking at us with his fingers. Baby... he said, laughing, ...food. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I didnt like the sound of that. There were a lot of ways to interpret that sentence, most of them nasty. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Did he mean that he could tell that Lizard was pregnant? Even we werent sure of that yet. Did he mean that the baby would be food? For who? Or did he mean that Lizard and I were baby food? And if so, how big was the baby? Or did he mean that Lizard was going to have a baby and she and I would need food? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Or did he mean something else entirely? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Dr. Guyer I took a painful step toward him. Can you help us? We need to contact our friends. We need to get out of here. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Shiny friends. Yes. Friends. Abruptly, his expression melted . He blinked. His mouth worked. He gurgled. And then his face reformed with a new sense of purpose. It was as if he were remembering how to be human againsomething he obviously hadnt had to do for almost a year. II He fumbled with the concept of being an individual, struggled with it long enough for it to be painfully uncomfortable, finally abandoned the effort. You he pointed at me. You dont want to know And then, for the first time, he spoke to me as clearly as if he were speaking to a soul-brother. You cant stay here. Youve got to leave. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Will you help us? Lizard asked. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">He blinked, startled. He looked at Lizard, as if surprised that she could speak. His presence flickered, faded, returnedI wondered who we were speaking to now. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">You need...friends, he said. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">We have friends. Theyre looking for us. Can you help them find us? </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Guyers expression crumbled inward. Had his moment of coherence passed? He giggled again. And then up he bounced, incredibly limber and away, vanishing into the darkness of the forest like a beam of sunlight suddenly shaded. </span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">I started to call after him, but the words choked in my throat. My god. If we were reduced to begging a madman for aid, then there really wasnt any hope for us at all.</span></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">We were alone in the heat and stink of the hungry red jungle. </span></font>
