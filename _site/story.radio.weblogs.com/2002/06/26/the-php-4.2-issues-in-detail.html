<font size="+1"><b>The PHP 4.2 Issues In Detail</b></font>

<p>All,</p>

<p>As I noted in an earlier blog entry, I got what I feel is HOSED (that’s not good) by the 4.2 release of PHP when my ISP installed it today.  Maxim, my editor in chief at <a href="http://www.phpbeginner.com">www.phpbeginner.com</a>, was technically savvy enough to attempt to make this acceptable to me.  And he did a great job.  But you’ll see my final response at the end. </p>

<p>I’d also like to really, really thank Guy K. Haas who was nice enough to both edit this document and confirm that I’m not nuts (at least to him, or we’re both nuts).  Guy has a history of working at the ANSI standards level for programming languages so it’s fair to say that he more than understands this. </p>

<p>Note – This one is real geeky although at least one of the fundamental issues at hand is economic.</p>

<p>– Scott</p>

<p>I knew about it because I am the PHP Dev Member. It was also documented.</p>
<p>Too sad these freaks of your ISP did not give a damn and did not bother</p>
<p>letting you know it in advance (or at least change the default settings</p>
<p>in the php.ini). They should be more responsible about such changes. I</p>
<p>can imagine many getting broken sites like you just did...</p>
<p>I saw <a href="http://www.fuzzygroup.com/php/faq/">http://www.fuzzygroup.com/php/faq/</a> - you better close the accesses</p>
<p>to the site before fixing it. It can be theoretically dangerous.</p>
<p>Meanwhile you are migrating to a better place, try adding the directives</p>
<p>in your .htaccess or directly the scripts if your ISP allows you to...</p>

<p>Oh don't get me wrong. I know how to fix it. I just strongly think</p>

<p>porked on this one. One of us should do an article on it.</p>
<p>I know but thanks.</p>
<p>It's not really my isp's fault in my mind. It was a bad change to make</p>

<p>Subject: RE: PHP 4.2 that sucky ass update</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Scott, let me explain you why these people at PHP Dev had to do so. (I</p>
<p>have also protested for the first time as I heard of it).</p>
<p>First, there will be no 5.0 - that is what Zeev personally have told me</p>
<p>some year ago on a meeting. Though, I have also heard the rumors/plans</p>
<p>of a work starting up on the skeleton 5.0. But see, and even if PHP 5</p>
<p>comes up, its major changes will be the parser and loads of new and</p>
<p>revised modules.</p>
<p>PHP 4 Parser is already good and with few bugs, however no one thinks it</p>
<p>should not be done better, more complex and flexible. And this is the</p>
<p>performance issue. To change the parser (and compiler) the market should</p>
<p>have a stronger HW. However, that is going to happen considering that</p>
<p>PHP 4 was written 2 years ago. In fact, you might have heard Zend</p>
<p>working on the Engine 2 (marketing again?).</p>
<p>Another reason is Apache 2 which is still far from being called stable.</p>
<p>This makes it impossible for PHP to make a stable Apache 2 module since</p>
<p>right now Apache 2 changes dramatically, jumping between alpha and beta</p>
<p>releases. This will continue for at least a few more months.</p>
<p>In other words, PHP 5.0, if ever released, would have its own</p>
<p>compatibility problems.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Second problem is the security.</p>
<p>Too many people have complained about the security vulnerability. Soon</p>
<p>afterwards, the press started to look down at PHP downgrading it in the</p>
<p>reviews with the excuse that the most popular programming language is</p>
<p>also the most insecure when in hands of those who "learn it real quick".</p>
<p>&gt;From e-business point of view this meant the disaster.</p>
<p>PHP 4.1 was releases with such fix. This in fact wasn't a fix but rather</p>
<p>was a forced incompatibility. It was the first time for PHP to change</p>
<p>the middle digit and was not usual. Magic Quotes were still default. And</p>
<p>here, rumors got even higher mentioning that even PHP Dev Group admitted</p>
<p>PHP being insecure. So, what they did was, month after 4.1.x release,</p>
<p>4.2 was out with MQ set to OFF by default.</p>
<p>I personally think this was way too quick for such major change, but I</p>
<p>do agree it was a must. From both - security and marketing points of</p>
<p>view. True, security is a transparent value, a programmer makes the</p>
<p>application secure, not the language... But too many newbies are out</p>
<p>there learning this still. Such feature, unfortunately, had to be</p>
<p>disabled by default. Yet, never so quickly and unexpectedly. That is how</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>Documentation Team also didn't do well documenting this, mentioning it</p>
<p>so alarming that everyone who downloads a new version knows that MOST</p>
<p>(not all, but most because there are also lots of Open Source apps that</p>
<p>rely on such feature) will get screwed up.</p>
<p>That is as far as I personally know and understand this whole thing. As</p>
<p>I said, I also got very frustrated hearing it for he first time, but if</p>
<p>you look deeper into the problem you will find that there were too few</p>
<p>better ways to make this major change.</p>

<p>Subject: RE: PHP 4.2 that sucky ass update</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sorry. Don't care. It may be the right technical decision but the handling</p>
<p>was bloody ass poor. This is simple abuse of your developer base. I've</p>
<p>heard the arguments before from James Cox. Still don't care. Backwards</p>
<p>compatibility is important.</p>
<p>If you are going to make this kind of change then what you do is simple.</p>
<p>You RADICALLY increment the version # even if there AREN'T other features to</p>
<p>justify if since it makes people be aware of it. I was majorly porked by </p>
<p>this change and I know I'm not alone. It's crap like this that makes people say</p>
<p>"Whoa! What are they going to do to me next time around when they want to change </p>
<p>something.  How much code do I have to rewrite then"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The better way to make this change was simple: Make it NOT the default. If</p>
<p>someone is concerned about security then THEY WILL make the effort to deal</p>
<p>with it. We all know that *nix, 2K, etc are all insecure out of the box.</p>
<p>And then you harden it as needed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All that is going to happen from this change is the following:</p>
<p>Users are going to react to this change in one of two ways: </p>
<p>* Move backwards in version #. (My response.)</p>
<p>* Override this option so it works like it did before.</p>
<p>I've run engineering teams for 15 years. If you think that we're all going</p>
<p>to go back and fix all our code because so Yahoo or Group of Yahoos decides</p>
<p>it's in our best interest then you're dreaming.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>[From Guy K. Haas: I was on the COBOL committee when they tried to get some changes into the</strong></p>
<p><strong>standard that would have allowed compilers to be delivered that would</strong></p>
<p><strong>disallow statements that had worked for 15 years because they had realized that</strong></p>
<p><strong>certain elements of the language had been categorized in the "wrong" division of the</strong></p>
<p><strong>program back then, and now should be in a different division. The THEORY</strong></p>
<p><strong>was that compilers would first report the old-style usage and alert customers </strong></p>
<p><strong>to change it. But the next release of the compilers could just honor the</strong></p>
<p><strong>new way and make the old way an error and the entire insurance industry</strong></p>
<p><strong>erupted.]</strong></p>
<p>Case in point: Have you fixed every single script on www.phpbeginner.com and</p>
<p>at your day job? I'll buy you dinner next month in Venice if you have and</p>
<p>we actually get together.</p>
<p>Your arguments are cogent and technically valid. That doesn't mean they are</p>
<p>correct. According to a partial directory list of my website archive I have</p>
<p>1,683 PHP scripts totaling 10,629,639 bytes. Assuming 1/2 hour to review</p>
<p>every script that's 841.5 hours of work. At my serious development rate of</p>
<p>$110 per hour that's a $92,565 cost item. And I'm one little guy with not</p>
<p>all that much code. A technically correct argument that is not economically </p>
<p>viable will basically fail every time. Anyone on the PHP team look at it that way?</p>
<p>I will, however, blog your response since I think it's valid. Thanks for</p>
<p>the input.</p>
<p>Scott</p></font>
  <p>## From Maxim to Scott:</p>
  <font size="2"><font size="2">
<p>See, Scott, soon or later this had to happen. Even today, there are some</p>
<p>people left running PHP 3. If turning magic quotes to off now breaks 70%</p>
<p>of PHP apps then one year later it would still be braking 30-40%. If you</p>
<p>talk about a complete compatibility then this would not happen anyway,</p>
<p>now or tomorrow.</p>
<p>The whole job in this was the documentation for the change. I wish there</p>
<p>was more responsibility towards those who might not have the habit</p>
<p>reading the docs saying: "new releases are always compatible...".</p>
<p>Would this decision be mine, I would do everything to let users know,</p>
<p>expect, discuss and create their patches BEFORE change it applied</p>
<p>permanently. I made one reverse patch already.</p>
<p>See: <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.variables.php">http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.variables.php</a>.</p>
<p>That was the real problem of this change - not giving enough time to</p>
<p>prepare the users for it.</p>
<p>I fixed PHP Beginner by simply turning back Magic Quotes to ON in the</p>
<p>php.ini file and by adding the patch (see the link) to my global</p>
<p>auto_prepend file.</p>
<p>True, I will lose the dinner because I will not have the perfect code</p>
<p>for the site without having to change it. Sadly, I don't even win it by</p>
<p>saying that I use Apache's mod_rewrite to handle ALL the arguments -</p>
<p>there's still one line to edit for me.</p>
<p> </p>
