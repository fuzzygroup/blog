<p><em>Marketing 101. Consulting 101. PHP Consulting. Random geeky stuff. I Blog Therefore I Am.</em></p>

<font size="+1"><b>An Open Source Evangelist Explains Open Source</b></font>

<p>My background is in commercial software development in a propietary environment.  Despite this background I have become a passionate advocate for Open Source in general.  There are a number of reasons for this, each of which are detailed below.  This document, written as a set of questions and answers, evolved from a chat session with the creator <a href="http://www.marketingconspiracy.com">www.marketingconspiracy.com</a> as I tried to explain to him what this is all about.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>travisdu: Scott…you around?<br />
fuzzygroup: I will be in about 20 minutes. Just awoke. tty after shower and caffeine hit of the morning.<br />
travisdu: ok<br />
travisdu: morning<br />
fuzzygroup: Morning<br />
travisdu: <br />
travisdu: bleary eyed?<br />
fuzzygroup: The vb code – how did you actually create it ? And what windows version is it for ?<br />
travisdu: lol….XP……<br />
travisdu: via a piece of software called…<br />
fuzzygroup: Ah. <br />
fuzzygroup: WinBatch ?<br />
travisdu: macro scheduler<br />
fuzzygroup: ok. Sec for more on that. <br />
travisdu: im begining to realize that….<br />
travisdu: using a software instead of knowing the base language limits my ability to….<br />
fuzzygroup: Yup<br />
travisdu: correctly create what i want and impliment it.<br />
fuzzygroup: Yup.<br />
travisdu: <br />
fuzzygroup: If it’s php you want to learn <br />
travisdu: lol<br />
fuzzygroup: then I can help a lot<br />
fuzzygroup: since I’m training my partner already.<br />
travisdu: php i may end up looking at yes….since<br />
travisdu: that seems to be the consensus best and..<br />
travisdu: agile.<br />
fuzzygroup: Well.<br />
fuzzygroup: Let me make a suggestion.<br />
travisdu: ok<br />
fuzzygroup: Why don’t you tell me what you want to do<br />
fuzzygroup: and then lets see if php is the right language<br />
fuzzygroup: i.e. match the investment to the problem so to speak<br />
travisdu: lol ok….i think its not worth the effort, like hitting a mouse with a sledgehammer when a trap would do fine.<br />
travisdu: im playing with start page exchanges is all.<br />
fuzzygroup: do you know the url to the scripting tool so i can look up a few things ?<br />
fuzzygroup: Ok<br />
fuzzygroup: So basically you want to customize your web sites ?<br />
fuzzygroup: (note – I’ll make a blog entry out of this most likely)<br />
travisdu: no no….do you know what a start page exchange is?<br />
travisdu: thats fine.<br />
fuzzygroup: no i guess not<br />
travisdu: <a href="http://www.startblaze.com">www.startblaze.com</a><br />
travisdu: when you start up your browser…<br />
travisdu: you have a predefined start page.<br />
fuzzygroup: ok<br />
travisdu: any way these exchanges have poped up around this principle…..<br />
fuzzygroup: ah.<br />
fuzzygroup: want an off the cuff comment based on looking at this very quickly ?<br />
travisdu: shoot<br />
fuzzygroup: What this seems to be about is a “easy” way to get trafffic.<br />
fuzzygroup: When I was a vp of engineering at a dot com<br />
fuzzygroup: our ceo wanted this type of stuff desperately<br />
fuzzygroup: I’m not certain that it’s possible.<br />
travisdu: correct…..a very poor quality form of traffic….<br />
travisdu: they are quite successfull so far but the traffic they attract is of….<br />
travisdu: fairly dismal quality.<br />
fuzzygroup: Really ?<br />
fuzzygroup: Yup.<br />
travisdu: the thing is that they have been so successfull…..<br />
fuzzygroup: question<br />
travisdu: sure.<br />
fuzzygroup: How do you know they are successful?<br />
fuzzygroup: (little known but true - the dot coms faked traffic all the time)<br />
travisdu: The number of webmasters that are using the exchanges numbers in the hundreds of thousands.<br />
travisdu: <a href="http://www.startblaze.com">www.startblaze.com</a> is in the top 100 on Alexa<br />
fuzzygroup: ok. but how do you know that ? Ah.<br />
fuzzygroup: Hmmmm<br />
fuzzygroup: i tend to be very cyncial on this stuff.<br />
travisdu: i am as well….<br />
fuzzygroup: It strikes me that blogging gets you more traffic and of more qualit<br />
fuzzygroup: y but the committment has to be there.<br />
travisdu: in fact i would say they are almost worthless…<br />
fuzzygroup: i.e. you need to make a blog and make it daily.<br />
travisdu: i agree….<br />
travisdu: I set up some of these exchanges for one of my pages….<br />
fuzzygroup: So, if it was me, I’d reorient my web marketing around a blog and see what happens<br />
travisdu: and am getting about 400 uniques a day…<br />
fuzzygroup: Ah. Interesting.<br />
travisdu: the thing is that….<br />
travisdu: each person viewing my page….<br />
fuzzygroup: Do you know the duration of traffic i.e.<br />
fuzzygroup: do they ever go deeper from the home page ?<br />
travisdu: only stays for a very short time….<br />
travisdu: hold on let me get this out…<br />
fuzzygroup: Ah.<br />
travisdu: so what is happening is that….<br />
fuzzygroup: Have you reverse dns’d the traffic ever ?<br />
fuzzygroup: sec<br />
travisdu: the exchanges are becoming about as worthwhile as your average persons spam.<br />
travisdu: k<br />
fuzzygroup: Ah. <br />
travisdu: im going to give you an url that will show you what i mean visually.<br />
travisdu: <a href="http://www.fastfreeway.com/start.php3?num=71670">http://www.fastfreeway.com/start.php3?num=71670</a><br />
travisdu: this should make it obvious<br />
travisdu: the top frame controls the display of the bottom frame as well as giving a certian time period for viewing.<br />
travisdu: most pages are for webmaster “opportunities” related to biz ops and such.<br />
fuzzygroup: Ah. <br />
travisdu: In any case ive been working on some….<br />
fuzzygroup: Ok. Before I forget I need the url for Macro Scheduler.<br />
travisdu: ahh ok….<br />
travisdu: <a href="http://www.mjtnet.com">www.mjtnet.com</a><br />
fuzzygroup: Ok. I need to go offline for a bit and focus on thsi. You around in an hour or so ?<br />
travisdu: yeah ill be around….<br />
travisdu: by the way…<br />
travisdu: I just found a site that blows me away….<br />
travisdu: mind you i have a really high bull meter.<br />
travisdu: <a href="http://www.marketingexperiments.com">www.marketingexperiments.com</a><br />
travisdu: so i dont say that often.<br />
travisdu: ill be around.<br />
fuzzygroup: k. ttyl.<br />
travisdu: politically incorrect website idea……www.nakedhomeless. com<br />
fuzzygroup: cool. <br />
travisdu: what do you think? should i run with it? <br />
fuzzygroup: why not ?<br />
travisdu: lol…sorry my brain wanders at these hours.<br />
fuzzygroup: whose doesn’t ?<br />
fuzzygroup: i mean do you know htat I’ve seen every sunrise in like 5 months now ?<br />
travisdu: you sound like that guy Warthom or whatever his name is.<br />
travisdu: the guy who created Mathimatica.<br />
fuzzygroup: lol. no he’s smart. i’m just driven.<br />
fuzzygroup: or nuts. take your pick.<br />
travisdu: i dont like to pick my nuts.<br />
fuzzygroup: lol. roflol.<br />
travisdu: anyway…im giving<br />
travisdu: drupal a second look at the moment.<br />
fuzzygroup: good. <br />
fuzzygroup: i tend to not push anything unless i have done a lot of looking at it.<br />
travisdu: success and frustration rolled into one package.<br />
fuzzygroup: and if you want me to just <br />
fuzzygroup: stuff an instance on my server for you<br />
fuzzygroup: that’s easy<br />
fuzzygroup: eliminates the frustration<br />
travisdu: nah i got it running.<br />
fuzzygroup: ok. just offering.<br />
travisdu: <a href="http://www.travisweb.com/index.php">www.travisweb.com/index.php</a><br />
travisdu: appreciate it.<br />
fuzzygroup: it looks like i’ll be helping get this going for a national blog community (still in negotiations)<br />
travisdu: i cant get the blocks to display on the left <br />
fuzzygroup: so the docs and themese will get a big boost<br />
travisdu: oh that would be cool<br />
fuzzygroup: Yup.<br />
travisdu: what do you mean by a national bloggin community?<br />
fuzzygroup: Think about a blogging community in a foreign country <br />
travisdu: Ahh ic.<br />
fuzzygroup: (asian) can’t say more yet.<br />
travisdu: no worries…..<br />
fuzzygroup: do you need a theme with blocks oon the left ?<br />
travisdu: why is it that most CMS are built in Europe?<br />
fuzzygroup: lol.<br />
fuzzygroup: there are a lot of reasons for that<br />
travisdu: LOL thats why it wont display on the left?<br />
travisdu: doh<br />
fuzzygroup: but it would be insulting to the europeans for me to go there<br />
travisdu: so?<br />
travisdu: <br />
travisdu: just playing<br />
travisdu: im german decent<br />
fuzzygroup: I need to politely find a way to say “99% of europeans are control freaks”<br />
fuzzygroup: and cms is about control<br />
travisdu: you mean a “marketing friendly” way to imply that lol<br />
travisdu: ahh i get ya<br />
fuzzygroup: but, never forget that the cms that make real <script type="math/tex">$ are us  
travisdu: US companies u mean?  
fuzzygroup: Yup  
travisdu: Can you recommend a theme for me?  
travisdu: i guess i could just download them all  
travisdu: but i dont know which ones work for the new version  
fuzzygroup: give me a bit of time and i'll find one for you.  
travisdu: nah no worries.....  
travisdu: i dont like to waste peoples time with stuff i can do myself.  
fuzzygroup: dpmt  
travisdu: i try not to be lazy.  
fuzzygroup: don't worry about it.  
fuzzygroup: i have to do one for gretchen's site anyway.  
travisdu: so from looking at it...drupal....  
travisdu: all the theme editing is done offline right?  
travisdu: i mean there is no interface.  
travisdu: correct?  
fuzzygroup: That's basically correct  
fuzzygroup: themes are definited in a code file.  
travisdu: or i should say admin display of the areas to edit.  
travisdu: right  
travisdu: is anyone doing marketing for Drupal?  
fuzzygroup: me  
fuzzygroup: i own [www.drupalhosting.com](http://www.drupalhosting.com) (nothing there yet)  
travisdu: Ill be honest with you i dont understand Open Source theology.  
fuzzygroup: ask away  
travisdu: Well if i understand it right...OP is based on...  
travisdu: the idea that if you build it, they will nead service correct?  
fuzzygroup: not really at all.  
travisdu: lol ok  
travisdu: how do they make money?  
fuzzygroup: Well. back up a bit.  
travisdu: ok  
fuzzygroup: The basic premise here is that OS is about "freedom"  
fuzzygroup: i.e the ability to control your own data and computing resources  
fuzzygroup: it's called "free as in beer"  
fuzzygroup: ie beer isn't free but you are free to do with it what you want  
travisdu: ok but they dont charge for the beer?  
fuzzygroup: Yes.  
fuzzygroup: So, for example, Red Hat can charge for the services around Linux but not for Linux itself  
travisdu: including the additions they have made to it.  
fuzzygroup: Yup.  
travisdu: hmmm....  
fuzzygroup: So what you pay for when you buy red hat is NOT the code but the packaging, the support contract, etc.  
travisdu: how does that protect Red Hat  
fuzzygroup: protect them from what ?  
travisdu: competition.  
fuzzygroup: Well  
fuzzygroup: it doesn't really but it also does  
fuzzygroup: for example [www.mandrake.com](http://www.mandrake.com) was origianlly a clone of Redhat right down to everything  
travisdu: ok   
travisdu: and?  
fuzzygroup: Well  
fuzzygroup: if you want to be successful you need to differentiate yourself (essensce of makreting)  
fuzzygroup: marketing that is  
travisdu: ic ic  
travisdu: ok here is the problem i have with OS...  
fuzzygroup: so what this all comes down to is that a bunch of geeks  
fuzzygroup: find a cool problem  
fuzzygroup: write some code  
fuzzygroup: if it gets up steam  
fuzzygroup: then others coalesce around it  
fuzzygroup: and then offer whatever else needs to be done (docs, etc)  
fuzzygroup: and, while its not perfect, there is one thing that everyone misses about it.  
travisdu: yes?  
fuzzygroup: A good OS product is substantially higher in quality than a commercial product.  
travisdu: example?  
travisdu:   
fuzzygroup: Well.  
fuzzygroup: Linux for example.  
fuzzygroup: Note quality is a fuzzy metric  
fuzzygroup: I would define it as "Software that don't crash"  
fuzzygroup: not as in "perfect docs"  
travisdu: ok ill give ya that one.   
fuzzygroup: Another example: Drupal.  
fuzzygroup: Ever see my performance analysis on drupal ?  
travisdu: Not ready for public consumption though.  
fuzzygroup: Disagree.  
travisdu: the average netizen can not use this.  
fuzzygroup: it's ready for their target market.  
fuzzygroup: And that's a geeky sort.  
fuzzygroup: It's not yet you.  
travisdu: hmmm ic i agree.  
travisdu: so they are going after....  
fuzzygroup: Here's another example  
fuzzygroup: QMail is an awesome mail server  
travisdu: the implimenter.  
fuzzygroup: They lack marketing in a formal sense you have to understand.  
fuzzygroup: So their target is really folks like themselves - geeky people that want to do cool web stuff.  
travisdu: right...  
travisdu: yeah its ready for them.  
fuzzygroup: Yes it is.   
fuzzygroup: And Linux on the Desktop really isn't there yet.  
travisdu: Here is my prob with open source personally.....  
travisdu: If i create a business.....  
fuzzygroup: But I would point out that our current high tech products all pretty much suck rocks today.  
travisdu: I want to be able to build into it the ability to build me out of it.  
fuzzygroup: Ah...  
travisdu: why would i want to create a service business.  
fuzzygroup: Well here is how this is generally done  
travisdu: i hate customer service.  
travisdu: hey Scott can you hold that thought...  
fuzzygroup: sure  
travisdu: i need to pee and smoke....  
travisdu: back in 5   
fuzzygroup: ok. ttyl.  
travisdu: k ditto  
travisdu: being able to pee and smoke is a decidedly male pleasure.  
travisdu: at the same time i mean.  
travisdu:   
fuzzygroup: lol. Yes.   
travisdu: ok here is my marketing plan for Drupal.....  
travisdu: give away the software.....  
travisdu: and sell easy to understand docs!!   
fuzzygroup: Sure. Nothing is stopping you from just doing that.  
travisdu: haha  
fuzzygroup: no seriously.  
fuzzygroup: One thing that people generally find bizarre  
travisdu: actually they should sell the modules.....ala Red Hat  
fuzzygroup: Red Hat doesn't sell modules, what do you mean ?  
travisdu: hmm...I thought Red Hat sold the....  
travisdu: package and docs and such.  
travisdu: basically their versioning.  
travisdu: addons and such.  
fuzzygroup: kind of.  
fuzzygroup: what they really sell is a box with a licnese to call for support  
travisdu: See thats my main prob with OS...let me explain with an example from my own biz.  
travisdu: The information I sold I could have easily given away....  
fuzzygroup: Sure  
fuzzygroup: and I think i know where you are going  
fuzzygroup: Yes it could have been given away.  
travisdu: the problem is that i have no desire to be a consultant  
fuzzygroup: But actually no.  
travisdu: there is no leverage in that.  
fuzzygroup: And I disagree  
fuzzygroup: Example.  
fuzzygroup: You create a book about Drupal.  
fuzzygroup: That book has a copyright that you own  
fuzzygroup: And you cna do with it what you like.  
travisdu: and Drupal org gets no piece?  
fuzzygroup: Nope!  
fuzzygroup: why would they ?  
travisdu: poopie for drupal.  
fuzzygroup: You did the work.  
fuzzygroup: Hmmm  
fuzzygroup: i think i'm miscommunicating something here.  
travisdu: I guess im trying to make parallels....  
fuzzygroup: Bear in mind that it's really not about</script>$ in the OS world.<br />
travisdu: to different products.<br />
fuzzygroup: It’s about “freedom”. <br />
fuzzygroup: The $$$ happen as a consequence of the freedom to make a better product<br />
fuzzygroup: Yeah. It’s communistic as hell.<br />
travisdu: The only corralary i see is to the tipping model that some …<br />
fuzzygroup: But in the end – what people buy is trust.<br />
travisdu: are using with success.<br />
fuzzygroup: For example, I’m a happy Red Hat customer for my server<br />
fuzzygroup: since I know it basically works.<br />
fuzzygroup: So i have (thru my ISP) a support contract<br />
travisdu: hmm ic interesting.<br />
fuzzygroup: Now lets go somewhere new<br />
fuzzygroup: Let’s say that you want to make some custom changes to Drupal to drive your business<br />
travisdu: ok<br />
fuzzygroup: You can do them yourself or hire (example) me to do them.<br />
fuzzygroup: Legally I have to contribute them back to the overall project<br />
fuzzygroup: Now the dupal guys may take them, reject them or whatever<br />
fuzzygroup: but the legal issue with the GPL license model <br />
fuzzygroup: is that you have to give back (under certain criteria)<br />
fuzzygroup: other licenses are different<br />
travisdu: Hmm ic<br />
fuzzygroup: now think about this.<br />
travisdu: I like that.<br />
fuzzygroup: Yes you end up helping someone else <br />
fuzzygroup: by this <br />
fuzzygroup: but you also could have spent hundreds of grand on traditional software<br />
fuzzygroup: if not millions<br />
fuzzygroup: Bear in mind that an oracle license for a big website is 6 to 7 figures<br />
fuzzygroup: so lets say that you wanted a new data type for your site<br />
fuzzygroup: its cheaper to hire a consultant to tweak MySQL or Postgres than it is to buy oracle<br />
travisdu: ok<br />
fuzzygroup: (if the software otherwise meets your needs)<br />
travisdu: hmm.. question…<br />
fuzzygroup: the give back is what people have the most problem wiht generally.<br />
fuzzygroup: Sure<br />
travisdu: do the guys at Drupal eat?<br />
fuzzygroup: Yup.<br />
fuzzygroup: Most of them have day jobs or are grad students (one is writing his phd on compilers)<br />
fuzzygroup: A huge amount of what drives this is the “I CAN DO THIS BETTER THAN X” mantra<br />
fuzzygroup: over time the good projects emerge into businesses<br />
fuzzygroup: and the bad ones stay labors of love<br />
travisdu: yeah ive gotten that.<br />
travisdu: lol<br />
fuzzygroup: or if not “bad” then “small”<br />
travisdu: well thanks for the newbie intro to OS.<br />
fuzzygroup: no prb. expect to see it written up sometime<br />
travisdu: Its just that its hard to watch….<br />
fuzzygroup: what url of your should i link it to ?<br />
fuzzygroup: Oh it is<br />
fuzzygroup: it’s like sausage<br />
fuzzygroup: you like the product<br />
travisdu: a product with potential….<br />
fuzzygroup: but you hate the process<br />
fuzzygroup: The way to look at it<br />
fuzzygroup: is that a little investment can have a big pay off<br />
travisdu: not have the resources of a traditional business.<br />
fuzzygroup: take a look at <a href="http://www.kerneltrap.org">www.kerneltrap.org</a><br />
fuzzygroup: that’s a drupal site<br />
fuzzygroup: it runs on a PII 300<br />
fuzzygroup: and has stood up to being slashdotted i.e. featured on slashdot<br />
fuzzygroup: It costs Jeremy like nothing other than 1 server at an ISP<br />
travisdu: slashdot is a portal of some sort?<br />
fuzzygroup: <a href="http://www.slashdot.com">www.slashdot.com</a><br />
fuzzygroup: is one of the highest traffic sites on the net<br />
travisdu: Ahh ic<br />
fuzzygroup: And when a site is featured on it<br />
travisdu: heard the name.<br />
fuzzygroup: the effect is called “slashdotting”<br />
fuzzygroup: it generally takes the site offline<br />
travisdu: lol<br />
fuzzygroup: No seriously<br />
fuzzygroup: <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0103807/documents/opensource_performance.pdf">http://radio.weblogs.com/0103807/documents/opensource_performance.pdf</a><br />
travisdu: like being on the homepage of yahoo or something.<br />
fuzzygroup: Yup<br />
fuzzygroup: That’s detailed traffic metrics<br />
fuzzygroup: basically they saw hits go up 600%<br />
fuzzygroup: within an hour of being featured<br />
fuzzygroup: He IM’d the drupal team<br />
fuzzygroup: and they tuned his site for him for free in real time<br />
fuzzygroup: Never crashed<br />
fuzzygroup: never died<br />
fuzzygroup: Labor of love and passion isn’t all bad.<br />
travisdu: real time….i didnt know that was possible.<br />
fuzzygroup: it’s weird as all hell though I’ll give you that<br />
fuzzygroup: Yup.<br />
fuzzygroup: Drupal has brilliant engineering underneath<br />
fuzzygroup: Contrast that with a microsoft product<br />
fuzzygroup: which would have required restarting and such<br />
travisdu: Yeah thats something i can “feel” just using it.<br />
fuzzygroup: Yup.<br />
fuzzygroup: So think of this in terms of your business goals<br />
travisdu: speaking of which will Yahoo IM ever be stable?<br />
fuzzygroup: lol.<br />
fuzzygroup: never.<br />
fuzzygroup: it actually can’t be due to the reliance on infernal exploder technology <br />
travisdu: what the hell is their problem…i should have never upgraded a year ago.<br />
fuzzygroup: Nope.<br />
fuzzygroup: And, that, my friend is my whole thesis<br />
fuzzygroup: Bear in mind that from a perspective of engineering<br />
fuzzygroup: we are at a point where its time to give it up <br />
fuzzygroup: and admit that the classical software engineering models of proprietary development just don’t work anymore<br />
fuzzygroup: If I had to put money on it, I’d bet that in the next 2 to 5 years you will see the entire commerical software business implode<br />
travisdu: No way.<br />
fuzzygroup: as customers say “You know this sh* doesn’t work”<br />
fuzzygroup: Yup.<br />
travisdu: to fast.<br />
fuzzygroup: Don’t think so<br />
fuzzygroup: Ever read “The Tipping Point”<br />
travisdu: Look at medicine….<br />
travisdu: that model has lasted a long long time and only now is showing signs of imploding.<br />
fuzzygroup: Also bear in mind that the OS revolution isn’t new <br />
travisdu: its a very slow process.<br />
fuzzygroup: it’s &gt; 15 years old now.<br />
fuzzygroup: Yes but high tech is the fastest cycle on the planet<br />
travisdu: hmm….thats true.<br />
fuzzygroup: and people are more pissed off than ever now<br />
fuzzygroup: I mean I’m a serious alpha geek on all dimensions<br />
fuzzygroup: and even I can’t make this sh* work generally.<br />
travisdu: lol no?<br />
fuzzygroup: Right now windows restarts cost me $4,500 annually in down time on my personal desktop<br />
fuzzygroup: alone<br />
fuzzygroup: and that’s conservative metrics<br />
travisdu: Ok but if OS is to survive then…..<br />
travisdu: it needs a body of people to organize its flow.<br />
fuzzygroup: (i did the cost factor analysis, I used to be a VP of engineering with 45 guys under me)<br />
fuzzygroup: Yes and No.<br />
fuzzygroup: Are you familiar with emergent systems and self organizing networks ?<br />
travisdu: yes they either dissipate or evolve to higher order.<br />
fuzzygroup: Yup.<br />
fuzzygroup: And think about Linux itself<br />
fuzzygroup: that’s what happened to it.<br />
fuzzygroup: It organized itself into RedHat, Mandrake, GenToo, etc.<br />
travisdu: So why so few viable products so far from OS?<br />
travisdu: in comparison.<br />
fuzzygroup: Few ?<br />
fuzzygroup: There aren’t few. <br />
travisdu: yes….products that have made the jump to….<br />
fuzzygroup: I think that most of them <br />
fuzzygroup: are ones that miss your personal radar.<br />
travisdu: why no mainstream then?<br />
fuzzygroup: well.<br />
travisdu: thats a viable arguement.<br />
fuzzygroup: Define Mainstream.<br />
fuzzygroup: If mainstream = desktop<br />
fuzzygroup: then yes<br />
travisdu: Their is a IM that is….<br />
travisdu: OS<br />
travisdu: and I dont use it.<br />
fuzzygroup: if Mainstream = server<br />
travisdu: cause its not as functional.<br />
fuzzygroup: You mean Jabber ?<br />
travisdu: correct<br />
travisdu: I use Trellian instead<br />
fuzzygroup: Which Jabber client are you running ?<br />
fuzzygroup: And do you use Trillian because it has interop or because of its features ?<br />
travisdu: hmmm….mostly interop<br />
fuzzygroup: (disclaimer - I hate trillian with the passion of a thousand dying suns)<br />
travisdu: lol why?<br />
fuzzygroup: Oh god. Sec for the url.<br />
travisdu: ok<br />
fuzzygroup: It sucks rocks basically<br />
fuzzygroup: And lots of folks love it i know.<br />
fuzzygroup: <a href="http://www.fuzzygroup.com/writing/marketing101_case_study_trillian.htm">http://www.fuzzygroup.com/writing/marketing101_case_study_trillian.htm</a><br />
fuzzygroup: basically they made a series of pathetically stupid human factors decisions that served no one other than their own vanity<br />
travisdu: ill read it….after we disco<br />
fuzzygroup: sure.<br />
travisdu: lol…<br />
travisdu: Hey Scott..<br />
fuzzygroup: Here’s an example of OS successes: something like 90% of the internet infrastructure in use is OS<br />
travisdu: let me pass your a url…<br />
fuzzygroup: sure<br />
travisdu: this will take a moment.<br />
travisdu: back in 2<br />
fuzzygroup: k</p>
