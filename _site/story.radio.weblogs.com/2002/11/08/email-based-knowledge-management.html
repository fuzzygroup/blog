<p>Email Based Knowledge Management</p>
<font size="2">
<p>Hi Zak,</p>
<p>[Disclaimer: I wrote like 90% of this on the plane back and then lost it in</p>
<p>a drafts folder. Sorry about the delay. Hope it's still useful. Let me</p>
<p>know if I can help at all. ]</p>
<p>-- Scott</p>
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>It was nice to meet you at PHP Con, in the bar with Jeremy on the last</p>
<p>night. You had mentioned building a classification system and I tossd</p>
<p>out a few throw away ideas. This email is the promised clarification of</p>
<p>said ideas.</p>
<p>So here's the problem that you are trying to solve (as I understand it</p>
<p>from the few comments you made):</p>
<p>a) You have a distributed group of largely technical folk who have</p>
<p>information flowing between them</p>
<p>b) Information is in different forms but is largely text data</p>
<p>c) Search in and of itself probably isn't sufficient to solve the</p>
<p>information access and organization problem -- classification is needed.</p>
<p>You made an extremely accurate remark, just prior to commenting on</p>
<p>classification, on the difficulties of both mailing lists and IM -- i.e.</p>
<p>who to contact, watching for the response, the fear being thought</p>
<p>foolish (I think this is my addition, not yours; either way). You then</p>
<p>made a comment about engineers contributing to a repository and</p>
<p>"categorizing / classifying it on entry".</p>
<p>My experience is that this tends to work poorly if at all for these reasons:</p>
<p>a) Classification is just plain hard. It's easy for the person who</p>
<p>creates the schema or taxonomy but, of course, much, much harder for the</p>
<p>person trying to use it.</p>
<p>(Anyone who's ever tried to understand the organization of a deep class</p>
<p>hierarchy like SmallTalk can sympathize with this.)</p>
<p>b) If you only go with 1 categorization entry it's the same as "what</p>
<p>folder to I put this email in". And you correctly pointed out any</p>
<p>classification system would have to support multiple categories per</p>
<p>entry. This, of course, raises the issue of over classification.</p>
<p>c) A practical matter is that browsers are very, very poor at</p>
<p>efficiently displaying trees of information that are selectable. I've</p>
<p>done this with Java for classification tools (kill me know) and DHTML is</p>
<p>better but still not good.</p>
<p>d) Classifying things well takes time. And, if contributions to a</p>
<p>repository take time, it isn't done. Period.</p>
<p>Sidebar: A way to encourage repository contributions is incentivizing</p>
<p>the process by tying it to a person's career path. Some of the big</p>
<p>consulting firms have had luck with this but it's very, very hard since</p>
<p>that then raises the issue of rating contributions, feedback,</p>
<p>correctness, etc.</p>
<p>So with this said, is classification dead? Is KM viable in a small,</p>
<p>distributed, busy organization? Not at all. Early KM systems (Dataware</p>
<p>II KMS, etc) tended to be large, centralized, bulky systems that</p>
<p>operated in a disjoint fashion from the organization's day to day</p>
<p>business activities). KM was a "special activity". That's just plain</p>
<p>wrong. It's distressingly wrong (disclaimer: I was the product manager</p>
<p>and one of the architects of the Dataware II KMS).</p>
<p>Here's how I would solve this problem today:</p>
<p>a) Adopt email as a first class input. I'd probably be tempted to</p>
<p>abandon the idea of a web form as an input source entirely. Very little</p>
<p>knowledge today doesn't pass through email at one point or another.</p>
<p>b) Make contributions to the repository as simple as forwarding, cc'ing</p>
<p>or bcc'ing an existing message / document attachment / url to a known</p>
<p>address. Say <a href="mailto:km@mysql.com">km@mysql.com</a> or "library@mysql.com".</p>
<p>c) Route those messages into a repository extracting from them metadata</p>
<p>as follows (this is a rough draft and would need more thought):</p>
<p>Subject ------- treat this as title</p>
<p>Contributor --- the sender</p>
<p>URLs ---------- I'd pull these into a separate table</p>
<p>Attachments --- I'd pull out type, size, filename into separate fields /</p>
<p>tables</p>
<p>OtherFolks ---- Any other people cc'd / authors on the message</p>
<p>Filenames ----- Since MySQL is a software company, being able to extract</p>
<p>from a message that there is a reference to queryoptimizer.c is probably</p>
<p>useful.</p>
<p>(Issues:</p>
<p>When the contributor of the article isn't the author who gets credit?</p>
<p>Depending on the complexity of signatures on the bottom of messages you</p>
<p>may need a "message zoning" algorithm that discards signatures</p>
<p>I'd also suggest that a supporting data table that references plain text</p>
<p>customer names to customer urls be part of the meta data system {or a</p>
<p>separate query expansion / query processor }. This would recognize that</p>
<p>anything with a url or email address that referenced "abcsystems.com" is</p>
<p>equivalent to "ABC Systems". This is very, very useful since we tend to</p>
<p>think and speak with the english not DNS at times.</p>
<p>If a customer has particular issues like "Jeremy = Large database |</p>
<p>Replication" then you could use this as a way to embed additional</p>
<p>classification tags.</p>
<p>)</p>
<p>d) Now, classification (you are probably thinking "Finally !"). There</p>
<p>are a couple of questions and issues to understand. The first issue is</p>
<p>simple: Key Words Suck Rocks. There are very few topics where a "key</p>
<p>word" really works well. This is particularly true in mature technical</p>
<p>fields where a vocabulary has grown up. Take my presentation on PHP</p>
<p>Login Security at this conference. Just the keyword <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0103807/2003/02/08.html#a1322">Security</a> is</p>
<p>pretty useless these days. It's much, much more effective to use something</p>
<p>like Porter's Stemming algorithm to generate key phrases. Look at search</p>
<p>results from this meta search engine <a href="http://www.queryserver.com/web.htm">http://www.queryserver.com/web.htm</a> and</p>
<p>search for "MySQL" (no quotes) which uses Porter's Stemming algorithm (this</p>
<p>was a product of mine once upon a time).</p>
<p>If you want to automatically assign classifications then I'd recommend</p>
<p>implementing Porter's Stemming and mapping the keywords to the taxonomy</p>
<p>entries. Rather than doing it all at once I'd build a training interface</p>
<p>which lets it be done with human assistance for the first X time periods.</p>
<p>Trying to get it right up front usually doesn't work.</p>
<p>Porter's Stemming is a fairly well understood bit of code with</p>
<p>implementations in most languages. Results vary based on language and it</p>
<p>works best in english. The algorithm implementation details are below.</p>
<p>Well I'm probably boring you with this by this point. Let me know if</p>
<p>you want more information</p>
<p>Best</p>
<p>Scott</p>
<p>-- porters stemming implementation (I'm not sure what the legal issues are</p>
<p>with my giving you this since there have been companies sold, people laid</p>
<p>off, etc. If you reproduce this then please don't reference</p>
<p>www.queryserver.com. It should be fine but always best to be cautious).</p>
<p>It is based on both title and summary, with phrases from the title having a</p>
<p>higher weight.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is a full description of the algorithm, for your comments....</p>
<p>a) Source of Candidate Phrases</p>
<p>Phrases are extracted from the result's title and summary, with each</p>
<p>occurrence of the phrase from the former contributing a weight of 2+2*N, and</p>
<p>each occurrence from the latter contributing a weight of 2+N, where N is the</p>
<p>number of search services that returned the result.</p>
<p>The weight of a phrase is the sum of the weights of the occurrences of the</p>
<p>phrase in the results.</p>
<p>b) Extraction of Words</p>
<p>The text to extract phrases from is split into words. A word is a set of</p>
<p>adjacent alphanumeric characters, which can also contain a hyphen (but not</p>
<p>start or end with a hyphen), and which can also end with "'s" (but not end</p>
<p>with "-'s"). Each word is assigned a type (see below), an ownership flag</p>
<p>(whether it ends with "'s"), a stop word flag (see below), and a punctuation</p>
<p>flag (whether punctuation exists between the word and the next).</p>
<p>A word's type is a set of flags which indicate the type of characters</p>
<p>present in the word. The flags, which are ORed together, are as follows: 1</p>
<p>= first char is lowercase, 2 = first char is uppercase, 4 = first char is</p>
<p>digit; 8 = subsequent char is lowercase, 16 = subsequent char is uppercase,</p>
<p>32 = subsequent char is digit; 64 = word contains hyphen. The word type is</p>
<p>used in the detection of stop words, and in determining the best form of a</p>
<p>word for display purposes.</p>
<p>The stop word flag is set if the word has one of the following</p>
<p>characteristics:</p>
<p>(i) The word length is 1.</p>
<p>(ii) The word consists entirely of digits.</p>
<p>(iii) The word consists entirely of lowercase or uppercase letters (but not</p>
<p>a mixture), and either the word length is less than 4 or the word is in the</p>
<p>stop word list.</p>
<p>(iv) The word starts with an uppercase letter and contains only subsequent</p>
<p>lowercase letters, and the word is not at the beginning of a sentence, and</p>
<p>either the word length is less than 4 or the word is in the stop word list.</p>
<p>(v) The word consists entirely of lowercase or uppercase letters (but not a</p>
<p>mixture) and contains a hyphen, and the word is in the stop word list.</p>
<p>(vi) The word starts with an uppercase letter and contains only subsequent</p>
<p>lowercase letters and at least one hyphen, and the word is not at the</p>
<p>beginning of a sentence, and the word is in the stop word list.</p>
<p>The stop word list currently contains the following words:</p>
<p>"about", "above", "across", "after", "afterwards", "again", "against",</p>
<p>"almost", "alone", "along", "already", "also", "although", "always",</p>
<p>"among", "amongst", "amount", "another", "anybody", "anyhow", "anyone",</p>
<p>"anything", "anyway", "anywhere", "around", "became", "because", "become",</p>
<p>"becomes", "becoming", "been", "before", "beforehand", "behind", "below",</p>
<p>"beside", "besides", "between", "beyond", "both", "cannot", "could",</p>
<p>"couldn", "done", "down", "during", "each", "either", "else", "elsewhere",</p>
<p>"empty", "enough", "even", "ever", "every", "everybody", "everyone",</p>
<p>"everything", "everywhere", "except", "first", "former", "formerly", "from",</p>
<p>"full", "further", "hasn", "have", "hence", "here", "hereafter", "hereby",</p>
<p>"herein", "hereupon", "hers", "herself", "himself", "however", "inc",</p>
<p>"indeed", "into", "itself", "last", "latter", "latterly", "least", "less",</p>
<p>"many", "meanwhile", "more", "moreover", "most", "mostly", "much", "must",</p>
<p>"myself", "namely", "neither", "never", "nevertheless", "next", "nobody",</p>
<p>"none", "no-one", "nothing", "nowhere", "often", "only", "onto", "other",</p>
<p>"others", "otherwise", "ours", "ourselves", "perhaps", "please", "rather",</p>
<p>"same", "seem", "seemed", "seeming", "seems", "serious", "several",</p>
<p>"should", "shouldn", "since", "sincere", "some", "somehow", "someone",</p>
<p>"something", "sometime", "sometimes", "somewhat", "somewhere", "such",</p>
<p>"than", "that", "their", "them", "themselves", "then", "thence", "there",</p>
<p>"thereafter", "thereby", "therefore", "therein", "thereupon", "these",</p>
<p>"they", "this", "those", "though", "through", "throughout", "thru", "thus",</p>
<p>"together", "toward", "towards", "under", "until", "upon", "very", "were",</p>
<p>"what", "whatever", "when", "whence", "whenever", "where", "whereafter",</p>
<p>"whereas", "whereby", "wherein", "whereupon", "wherever", "whether",</p>
<p>"which", "while", "whither", "whoever", "whole", "whom", "whose", "will",</p>
<p>"with", "within", "without", "would", "your", "yours", "yourself",</p>
<p>"yourselves"</p>
<p>The beginning of a sentence is determined by the end of a word being</p>
<p>followed by either one of the letters</p>
<p>.!?:</p>
<p>or by one of the letters</p>
<p>')"</p>
<p>followed by one of the above letters.</p>
<p>c) Formation of Candidate Phrases</p>
<p>A four word window is moved through the text to extract phrases from. If</p>
<p>the first word in the window is a stop word or is followed by punctuation,</p>
<p>the window is moved on one word. Otherwise, if the second word is not a</p>
<p>stop word, then a two-word phrase is formed from the first and second words</p>
<p>in the window. If the second word is followed by punctuation, the window is</p>
<p>moved on one word. Otherwise, if the third word is not a stop word, then a</p>
<p>three-word phrase is formed from the first, second and third words in the</p>
<p>window. If the third word is followed by punctuation, the window is moved</p>
<p>on one word. Otherwise, if the fourth word is not a stop word, then a</p>
<p>four-word phrase is formed from the first, second, third and fourth words in</p>
<p>the window. Then the window is moved on one word. At the end of the text,</p>
<p>three and two word windows allow the last words in the text to form phrases.</p>
<p>Each phrase formed is added to a master phrase list. Two phrases are deemed</p>
<p>equal if the stems of their words are identical. Stemming is performed with</p>
<p>Porter's stemming algorithm, with a modification to remove "'s" where</p>
<p>present.</p>
<p>When adding a new occurrence of a phrase, the words in the phrase are</p>
<p>compared. The best form of words is kept, to improve the phrase display. A</p>
<p>"good" word is one whose ownership flag is not set, and which starts with an</p>
<p>uppercase letter and contains only subsequent lowercase letters.</p>
<p>d) Reduction of Candidate Phrases</p>
<p>At the end of the processing of the title and summary from each result, the</p>
<p>master phrase list contains a list of phrases, each with an associated</p>
<p>weight. Most of these phrases will be junk or subsets of other phrases, and</p>
<p>these have to be removed. The following methods are used, in the given</p>
<p>order:</p>
<p>(i) If phrase 1 starts or ends with phrase 2 (when comparing word stems),</p>
<p>and phrase 2's list of contributing results is a subset of phrase 1's list,</p>
<p>then phrase 2 is removed.</p>
<p>(ii) Phrases with only one contributing result are removed.</p>
<p>(iii) Phrases whose weight is less than 14 are removed.</p>
<p>(iv) For each of the results, only the three phrases with the greatest</p>
<p>weights are retained. All occurrences of other phrases are removed. [Note:</p>
<p>this is a weakness as the top four phrases may have identical weights]</p>
<p>(v) Phrases with only one contributing result are removed.</p>
<p>(vi) Phrases whose weight is less than 10 are removed.</p>
<p>(vii) For each of the results, only the phrase with the greatest weight is</p>
<p>retained. All occurrences of other phrases are removed. [Note: again,</p>
<p>this is a weakness as the top two phrases may have identical weights]</p>
<p>(viii) Phrases with only one contributing result are removed.</p>
<p>(ix) Phrases whose weight is less than 6 are removed.</p>
<p>This gradual trimming down of the number of phrases allows those results</p>
<p>whose top phrase eventually gets removed to be listed under their second or</p>
<p>third phrases.</p>
<p>e) Display of Phrases</p>
<p>Each phrase is listed with its contributing results. Any results whose</p>
<p>contributions have been removed from all the retained phrases are listed</p>
<p>under the "Other Sites" phrase.</p>
<p>If the reduction phase removes every phrase, then a normal list display will</p>
<p>be performed, as if clustering was switched off.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some points...</p>
<p>a) The clustering only works properly in English, as it uses Porter's</p>
<p>stemming algorithm and an English stop word list.</p>
<p>b) The algorithm used to detect end of sentences could be improved.</p>
<p>c) The phrase reduction algorithm could be improved - currently I have seen</p>
<p>results which contain one of the phrases listed, but which are listed under</p>
<p>"Other Sites".</p>
