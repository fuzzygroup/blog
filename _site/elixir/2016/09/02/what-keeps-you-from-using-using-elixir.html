    <p>So I’m at roughly 35,000 feet coming back from ElixirCon, and I saw a tweet that sparked my interest: <a href="https://twitter.com/georgeguimaraes/status/771722738994180096">What Keeps You from Using Elixir?</a>.  Wow.  That’s a fantastic question.  I’d like to break that down to three issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Elixir Language</li>
  <li>The Phoenix Framework</li>
  <li>Deployment</li>
  <li>Ecosystem</li>
</ul>

<p>This is exactly the right question to ask and I believe that the author works for Platformatec so this is effectively market research for them and I’m delighted to answer at least for myself.</p>

<p>Personally I’m a hard core rubyist.  I’ve been using Ruby since 2006 and Rails since 2007.  I’m responsible for a pure ruby codebase doing hardcore data processing at a very large scale (6,000,000 data points per day) for one application / 1/4 terabyte of crawled data per month for another application. Our aggregate code base is approaching 500,000 lines of code in total and the design pattern is, well, the all too familiar <strong>Ruby Monolith</strong>.  I came to ElixirCon because the tooling I’ve devoted over a decade to simply can’t cut it anymore.  Its is the fragility that all of us know all too well:</p>

<ul>
  <li>brittle gem stack (but better than Node)</li>
  <li>test coverage that runs slowing, inconsistently if at all</li>
  <li>performance issues that range from annoying to dreadful</li>
</ul>

<p>Now don’t get me wrong – I actually do love ruby but I no longer feel like I can build stable, reliable distributed systems with it.  And, honestly, the less reliable my systems are the less time I can get with my wife and kids.  After over a decade of ruby, the failures just aren’t fun anymore.  I go into work and it feels, too often, like I’m an architect building something on a foundation of wet sound.</p>

<p>Personally I’ve been experimenting with Elixir now since <a href="http://localhost:4000/blog/elixir/2016/03/05/getting-started-installation.html">March 5, 2016</a> and I still don’t have anything save toys so, now with the context in place, let’s talk about the issues.</p>

<p>I’d draw a firm distinction between the Elixir language and the phoenix framework.</p>

<h1 id="elixir">Elixir</h1>

<p>Getting going with a new language in production is <strong>hard</strong>.  And its particularly hard when the language breaks with existing paradigms and then leverages other technology (Erlang).  You end up having to master a language and then master the other technology.  And even if you don’t have to master Erlang to use Elixir you do have to be able to get it running and feel comfortable with it in a production context.</p>

<p>However, for most of us, I think the issue comes down to finding that perfect penetration point.  The killer app which the language is really good for.  Its taken me six months to figure that out for my organization and I finally have it.</p>

<p>Maybe Platformatec needs to work on a twitter campaign like #MyElixirKillerApp and get people talking about what they want to use Elixir for.  We all just saw #MyElixirStatus do quite well over the past few days.</p>

<h1 id="phoenix">Phoenix</h1>

<p>Phoenix is interesting as heck to me although Chris McCord’s presentation yesterday on changes to the layout does make me a bit apprehensive.  Knowing that major changes are coming to the layout makes me mildly concerned about starting work on it today – although I did start on an application before I boarded this plane.  Honestly the single biggest thing that concerns me about Phoenix is having to write the authentication layer myself.  I’m hard pressed to think of anything I’ve built in the last 5 if not 10 years that didn’t have login as part of it.  So the concept that I have to roll my own authentication for Phoenix when I know that Devise comes from the parents of Elixir really bothers me.</p>

<p>And don’t get me wrong, I know that I can build a simple password form and use Comeonin for hashing.  And it doesn’t even have to be Devise but I’m very reluctant to implement security in what is to me a brand new language and brand new framework.  I’m too damn likely to screw something up and leave a hole.  I don’t have to have all the features of Devise but I really feel like this out to be a provided facility and not something that we all implement poorly.</p>

<p><strong>Sidebar:</strong> I don’t even like Devise; I struggle with it regularly but I trust their understanding of security better than my own.  The guy who <a href="https://fuzzygroup.github.io/blog/software%20engineering/2016/09/02/what-wolfram-arnold-taught-me.html">taught me rails</a> drilled this into me when I started and its as good advice now as it was then.  People who exploit security holes are scary good.</p>

<h1 id="deployment">Deployment</h1>

<p>I should admit that I couldn’t make the deployment presentation at ElixirConf so perhaps the answer as at the conference and I missed it.  The state of deployment for an Elixir / Phoenix “thing” bothers me.  I know that I can develop in it but I don’t fully understand how I regularly get this into my daily code / fix / release workflow.  I do know that the state of Ruby deployment in the early days was poor and that makes me think that things aren’t all that different.  And perhaps the answer is that classical deployment is irrelevant and all this needs to be done at the container level. If so then that’s another issue since not all of us are fully conversant with containers yet.</p>

<h1 id="ecosystem">Ecosystem</h1>

<p>For all the bashing of</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>I really, really want to use Elixir / Phoenix.  Ever since the first day, picking up my rails apps has</p>
