    <p>So here's the report on the 1st day of the 30 days.  Here's what it looks like on my system:</p>
<p align="center"><img width="128" height="96" alt="GDS Main Screen" src="/blog/assets/thumb-gds-main.jpg" /></p>
<p align="center">
<p>And here are some details:</p>
<ul>
<li>I moved it from the far right hand edge of the screen to the far left.  That feels more right for what its worth.</li>
<li>I've seen a few window redraw issues and my windows programming experience says that that's tied to applications grabbing the wrong screen contexts / sizes and making assumptions that they had the whole display area.  Given that I didn't see any of that before I moved it, there must be some bad fu associated with left hand side of the screen (and that's likly why Google put it on the right).  Still I read from left to right so having it on the left feels right.</li>
<li>The internal notepad, "Scratch Pad", is brilliant.  All of my machines since 1995 have had a single file, todo.txt, launched at startup into notepad.exe or another editor.  Why?  Well its my equivalent of a sticky pad / writing on the screen.  This is better since its moderately visual and I can always see it.</li>
<li>So that's great BUT their own search engine can't find text you type into it.  I started by entering "where doth these notes go" into the Scratch Pad but now 12 hours after I typed it in, its still not indexed.  Consistency thy name is engineer!</li>
<li>Not knowing where the data is stored for Scratch Pad bothers me a lot but that's just me.</li>
<li>The little todo list widget is nice.  Very nice.  I'm the classically disorganized guy who focuses hugely on what's in front of him so having this is cool.</li>
<li>The email widget is really, really nice but I don't understand the filters UI at all.  Here's what it looks like:
<p><img width="110" height="96" alt="GDS Filters" src="/blog/assets/thumb-gds-filters.jpg" /></li>
<li>I know that's hard to see but the idea is that you put in terms of what you don't want to see in your list of emails.  I like that because I don't want a list of 10,000 messages in here.  But what I don't understand is how to use this dialog.  Subject is a text field as is From and To.  So do I put the words in the subject field or the Has the Words field.  I suspect that what they wanted was a checkbox or radio button here.  Recommendation: See Thunderbird's filters dialog box.  While I have many, many issues with Thunderbird, they really did get filters right.</li>
<li>It seems hard to do filename searches or perhaps it was still indexing my disc.  I wanted to hack the iPodder / Juice code a wee bit to help my snaky goodness (Python) and was looking for xrced and all it found was a mail message containing a reference to xrced but not the xrced script.</li>
<li>I'm hugely biased towards currency in search results.  Hey I founded Feedster right?  For me currency is often all that matters.  If I'm searching for *.doc what I want are the latest *.doc files NOT everything on my blasted hard disc.  I'd strongly recommend to whoever writes this absolute gem of a piece of software that they read <a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/people/faculty/gelernter.html">Gelertner's</a> papers on the Timestream / Lifestream approach to organizing data.  Gelertner rocks.</li>
</ul>
<p>But overall I still love this little beast.  Its actually gotten me to respond to emails which any long time reader knows I generally don't do.</p>
