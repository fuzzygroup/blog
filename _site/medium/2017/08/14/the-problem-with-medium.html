    <p>Yesterday I was at the movies with my son and during the endless roll of trailers, promos and advertisements, I was terribly, terribly bored so I dropped into the Medium app and saw something that I <strong>knew</strong> I wanted to read in more depth so I hearted it (by hearted I mean I clicked on the heart icon on the toolbar and watched it change color).  I figured that would be enough to find it later.  I also remembered a little bit about it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>author: james altschuler</li>
  <li>keywords: hedge fund marriage thestreet.com</li>
</ul>

<p>Just to cut to the chase, here's the <a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/step-by-step-guide-to-make-10-million-and-then-totally-blow-it-a9283b6de90c">exact article</a> but the process by which I found something that I had:</p>

<ul>
  <li>already read</li>
  <li>that I had hearted as a favorite</li>
  <li>that I knew had certain keywords</li>
</ul>

<p>was an absolute usability failure and one that I just don't understand.</p>

<h1 id="usability-failure-1---where-are-my-hearted-things">Usability Failure #1 - Where Are My Hearted Things?</h1>

<p>The next day I went to Medium in my laptop's browser and signed in and I <strong>could not</strong> find the things I liked.  So I looked again, nope.  My next thought was ok maybe these are just stored in the Medium app on my phone – nope I couldn't find anything there either.  This led me back to my laptop's browser where I finally googled it and found a <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-find-a-list-of-all-the-articles-I-recommended-on-Medium">Quora post</a> that talked about it but their solution was no longer part of the Medium user interface.  They also pointed out that you could goto http://medium.com/@user/has-recommended and find your posts.  I typed in the correct url for me: <a href="http://medium.com/@fuzzygroup/has-recommended">http://medium.com/@fuzzygroup/has-recommended</a> and that actually did work but the question remains:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Medium has serious founders, serious money, serious talent – how can this be a problem?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: I never did find a way to get back to my hearted items on my phone.</p>

<h1 id="usability-failure-2---search">Usability Failure #2 - Search</h1>

<p>When I couldn't find the article I <strong>knew</strong> was there, I turned to search as the next obvious way to find it.  Here was my process:</p>

<ol>
  <li>So I started with a search for <a href="https://medium.com/search?q=james%20altschuler">james altschuler</a> and that gave zero hits.</li>
  <li>Then I continued with a search for <a href="https://medium.com/search?q=thestreet.com">thestreet.com</a> and that gave me hits but not the article I knew I had read.  Now I have no problem with a spelling error on altschuler but "thestreet.com" – <strong>nope</strong>.</li>
  <li>I then proceeded to search for <a href="https://medium.com/search?q=hedge%20fund">hedge fund</a> and again the article that I wanted wasn't there.</li>
  <li>Ok I'll accept that there are lots and lots of articles about hedge funds but how many <a href="https://medium.com/search?q=hedge%20fund%20marriage">hedge fund articles talk about the collapse of his marriage</a> - that must work, right?  Nope.  That three word query brings back just a <a href="https://medium.com/thinkprogress/hedge-fund-manager-runs-anti-gay-attack-ad-against-liz-cheney-2e851c82b758">single article</a>.  Interestingly Google finds <a href="https://www.google.com/search?biw=1313&amp;bih=646&amp;q=site%3Amedium.com+%22hedge+fund%22+%22marriage%22&amp;oq=site%3Amedium.com+%22hedge+fund%22+%22marriage%22&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...34964.39387.0.39831.4.4.0.0.0.0.62.207.4.4.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..0.0.0.FNpHjvAPKsM">360 things</a> on medium that contain hedge fund and marriage and the post I was looking for was on the second page.  I ran the google search with "hedge fund" and "marriage" to force all the terms to be in there as well as to treat "hedge fund" as a string.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="how-did-i-finally-find-it">How Did I Finally Find It?</h1>

<p>I finally ended up giving up on Medium's user interface and its search engine and using my incorrect version of the author's name and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Amedium.com%20james%20altschuler">Google found the right author as the very first result</a>.  I then scrolled down and found <a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/step-by-step-guide-to-make-10-million-and-then-totally-blow-it-a9283b6de90c">the article</a>.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>By any Silicon Valley standards, Medium is a real thing:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_(website)">5 years old</a></li>
  <li>Incredible Founder - Blogger and Twitter were Ev's prior companies</li>
  <li>Huge $$$ - More than <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/21/medium-series-c/">$107 Million</a></li>
  <li>Has north of <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-many-employees-does-Medium-have-What-do-they-do">167 employees</a> as of November 2015</li>
</ul>

<p>It is very, very hard for me to understand this level of usability failure at a company with these type of metrics.  I can, perhaps, excuse the user interface to hearted items as being a redesign where something got lost in the shuffle.  But the search failure is deeply, deeply troubling.  If you're in the content business then search is a <strong>requirement</strong> not an option and a search algorithm that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>deals with misspellings</li>
  <li>takes into account user input such as hearts / likes</li>
  <li>actually finds the damn keywords the user puts in</li>
</ul>

<p>should not be a problem in 2017.  I'm spent my career in search in retrieval and we were solving these types of issue back in the early 90s if not sooner.  I just can't fathom exactly what Medium is doing but they would likely be better served at this point by just embedding google instead of whatever search tool they've</p>

<p>If you have search and retrieval needs, I've spent a long time working on these kinds of issues and I'm always happy to talk to potential clients.  My contact details are on <a href="http://fuzzyblog.io/blog/resume.html">my resume</a>.</p>
