    <p>Although I'm now happily ensconced in the mid west, once upon a time, in a vastly different personal universe, I lived in Boston.  And I think the happiest times I had in Boston were the brief period where I was part of the informal Boston blogging crowd centered around <a href="http://www.scripting.com/">Dave Winer</a>, the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman Center at Harvard</a> and a random crew of people that drifted into that orbit.  Among those people were:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.scripting.com/">Dave Winer</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://betsydevine.com/blog/">Betsy Devine</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://halleyscomment.blogspot.com/">Halley Suitt</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://rura.org/shimon/">Shimon Rura</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.markbernstein.org/">Mark Bernstein</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/jkbaumga/">Jessica Baumgart</a></li>
  <li>Myself and many others</li>
</ul>

<p>All of us were drawn together to the hotness of a new medium and it had, as best as I can tell, the feeling of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_(gathering)">18th century salon</a>.  Everything was new; the people were excited and it felt like something was brewing.</p>

<p>Today I'd like to talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betsy_Devine">Betsy Devine</a> and what I learned from her.  I first met Betsy in roughly May 2003 as dated by <a href="https://fuzzygroup.github.io/blog/story.radio.weblogs.com/2003/05/11/boston-beach-blogging-bingo.html">this url</a> where she was present; the pictures aren't present any more – I'll fix that some other time so you'll have to take my word for it.</p>

<p>At the time I didn't really know Betsy very well but here's what I did and didn't know:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I knew she was pleasant.</li>
  <li>I knew she was clearly smart as a whip but I was in my mid 30s and Betsy was my Mom's age so I suspect I didn't give all the respect I should have.</li>
  <li>I didn't know that she was a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Longing-Harmonies-Themes-Variations-Physics/dp/0393305961/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1479718439&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Longing+for+the+Harmonies">published author</a> (yes I just ordered it and you likely should to if you're bothering to read this).</li>
  <li>And I knew she was kind which is a character trait all to often overlooked and all too often ignored.</li>
</ul>

<p>And then in 2004 Betsy's life changed dramatically – her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Wilczek">husband</a>, someone I knew slightly from having carved <a href="http://betsydevine.com/blog/page/89/?s=devine">this pumpkin at their house on October 22, 2003</a>, won the <strong>Nobel Prize</strong> in Physics.  At the time I met him, I was told "hey - here's Betsy's husband - he teaches at MIT".  And, yes, MIT is impressive but he's a teacher (and a very pleasant fellow).  And so Betsy went from being just Betsy to being the wife of a legitimate celebrity.</p>

<h1 id="learning-the-first-celebrity-changes-things">Learning the First: Celebrity Changes Things</h1>

<p>In modern culture celebrity is an odd thing.  I work alone, from home, in a pitch dark room, most days so I clearly fall into the introvert camp and I've never cared much for it but I've had a few random encounters with celebrities over the years:</p>

<ul>
  <li>My first partner physically crashed into Bill Gates at a CD-ROM conference back in maybe '91 and almost took him out</li>
  <li>I stayed on Ted Turner's yacht once upon a time when my Dad and I were hunting</li>
  <li>My Dad's best friend, Jim Mattingly, <a href="http://forum.sailingscuttlebutt.com/cgi-bin/gforum.cgi?post=7816#7816">skippered Tenacious in the Fastnet Race in '79</a>.  He was then featured in posters that ran for years in the boating industry (I grew up in boating)</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Rooney">Andy Rooney</a> used to shop at one of my family's wood working businesses and he was exactly the same in person as on 60 minutes</li>
</ul>

<p>But, even with some exposure to celebrities all through my youth, I suspect on some level, post 2004, I viewed Betsy at least a little bit as "wife of a nobel laureate" instead of as "Betsy".  Apologies for that.</p>

<p>Normally this is where I end this type of post but not this time.  Upon reflection I learned at least two more things from Betsy.</p>

<h1 id="learning-the-second-never-ever-underestimate-the-brains-people-have">Learning the Second: Never, Ever Underestimate the Brains People Have</h1>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Joy">Bill Joy</a> is a computer scientist, a co-founder of Sun Microsystems, the primary author of BSD unix and too many other technical achievements to write down and the author of Joy's Law:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Joy's law is the principle that "no matter who you are, most of the smartest people work for someone else,” \ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy's_law_(management)">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now Bill Joy wrote this in the context of Sun, Microsoft and technical nerds and who they work for but I would actually expand it to be something far more expansive:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are smart people all around you.  And at least one of them is almost certainly smarter than you are.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From my initial perspective Betsy was a mom, heck, she even looked like my mom.  What I didn't realize at the time, and wouldn't realize for literally years to come, was just how <strong>damn smart</strong> she was.  I should have taken a clue from the fact that she wrote humor professionally.  Comedians are always smart and that should have tipped me off.  Or I should have taken a clue from the fact that she had a Masters in Materials Science Engineering from Princeton.  How smart did she have to be to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>get into princeton</li>
  <li>get into a technical field</li>
  <li>get into a technical field as a woman in 1978??</li>
  <li>get a master's degree that almost certainly required a thesis</li>
</ul>

<p>I suspect that by any measure there's far more depth to Betsy's smarts then I'll ever know. There are literally smart people all around you; never, ever, underestimate the brains people have.</p>

<h1 id="learning-the-third-what-might-betsy-have-done">Learning the Third: What Might Betsy Have Done?</h1>

<p>Gender and identity politics is a dicey subject in America in 2016 so I write this with no small degree of trepidation.  It is the reason that as a profoundly white male of privilege – the only college nickname I ever had was, I kid you not, <em>Captain Whitebread</em> – I actually had Betsy read this in advance of posting since I didn't want to stick my foot in my mouth.</p>

<p>So my third learning is more of a zen like question – Why Might Betsy Have Done?  As a woman, even an accomplished woman, in the late 1960s / 1970s, Betsy went down a fairly traditional route of wife and mother but also kept herself as a distinct entity.  That's a challenge because raising a family is an all consuming past time.  I say that as a father and husband who has seen that his wife has a harder "job" that he has.  And my wife certainly has a more important job than I have.  My work product is literally ephemeral – I write lines of code that often don't survive a week.  My wife?  She's takes little people and day by day turns them into big people.  Every product I've ever written – and I've written a lot of them – will be gone someday, generally soon – but my wife's "work product" will last forever.</p>

<p>So I have damn near infinite respect for what Betsy did.  But when I see how smart she is and how smart she has to be it makes me wonder what she might have done.  Perhaps in a slightly different universe she might have the Nobel prize.</p>

<p>So the next time you see a wife and mother and look at the accomplishments that their husband has you should really wonder what that wife and mother might have done on their own.</p>

<h1 id="learning-the-fourth-engage-more-with-women-at-work">Learning the Fourth: Engage More with Women at Work</h1>

<p>For a brief period Betsy helped out with Feedster back in 2003 / 2004 and she added very real value.  One of the things I noticed was that she made a great team player and brought a very different perspective to things.  So the next time you see a woman at work, whether she's "technical" or not, recognize that she's almost certainly smart and there is a fair chance you're underestimating her.  Men are notorious for that and there's no reason for it in this day and age.</p>

<p>And that's the fourth learning.</p>
