<p>This is another one of those "Tales from the Past" blog posts where something kicked off a memory.  In this case, I was at a conference and talking with someone who was President of a startup and they weren't quite sure what to do.  They had found themselves, at a very early stage, sidelined in their own venture and pigeon holed into a tiny portion of the business.  And, keep in mind, that they did have specialized domain knowledge of that portion but still …</p>

<p>As I listened to them talk, I had a terribly blunt and not politically correct message for them.  They encouraged me to be direct and so, I'm going to be mildly offensive here (bear in mind that I was talking to a woman when I said this a bunch of years ago):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Strap your balls on and be the damn President"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I said that a bunch of years ago and while I find it more offensive today, I believe that it is still good advice.  But before we get to that, let's talk about the "stages" of a startup.</p>

<h2 id="the-stages-of-a-startup">The Stages of a Startup</h2>

<p>Startups exist at all types of "stages". Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stage Zero</li>
  <li>Angel Funded</li>
  <li>Seed Funded</li>
  <li>Venture Funded</li>
  <li>Pre IPO</li>
  <li>Mature</li>
</ul>

<p>Every one of these stages is different but the President's role, in a Stage Zero startup is particularly important:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The President's role in a Stage Zero startup is very, very simple.  The President does whatever is needed to will the startup into existence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's a Scott Johnson quote; I said this.  And I can say it, with a high degree of authority, because I've done it multiple times in my life.  When I started my first software company, I was 19 and I dropped out of college to create hypertext linking software (this was 4 years before Tim Berners Lee created the world wide web).  When I say "will it into existence", I know what I'm saying because when I did this, I wasn't a programmer or a software engineer; I simply wanted to create this product.  Creating that company, NTERGAID, was literally an act of will.</p>

<p>And, despite all the pain that goes into a Stage Zero startup, one of my favorite stages in a startup is what I refer to as <strong>Stage Zero</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-stage-zero-for-a-startup">What is Stage Zero for a Startup?</h2>

<p>As I look at startups, Stage Zero is what you have – before you have anything.  Stage Zero can mean:</p>

<ul>
  <li>3 guys around a placemat in a restaurant idly dreaming</li>
  <li>A business plan that you haven't shown anyone</li>
  <li>A team that isn't yet operating</li>
  <li>A pile of code and a running website that isn't really a business yet</li>
</ul>

<p>In essence, Stage Zero is what you have <strong>before you start</strong>.  You don't have investors, you don't have customers, you don't have product-market fit and you generally don't even have a product.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-a-president-do-at-stage-zero">What Does a President Do at Stage Zero?</h2>

<p>When you come to a startup leadership position from a mature industry, you often have the idea that you have a specific tasks or tasks in front of you.  In a startup that simply isn't true.  Here's what a President does in a Stage Zero startup:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They do whatever it takes to come to market.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An expression that I personally love is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_hog,_or_die">Root, Hog or Die</a> which, according to Wikipedia, is "an idiomatic expression for self-reliance".  And that's the nature of being President of a startup, you have to be self reliant because there aren't the other people around to do things that exist in a mature organization.</p>

<p>On any given morning in a startup, the President's tasks might include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Settling a dispute between engineering (ok; the one engineer you have hired) and "product management" (the one person who owns the product vision)</li>
  <li>Editing copy on the website</li>
  <li>Cleaning the bathroom</li>
  <li>Arranging for food for the people that are staying late tonight</li>
  <li>Worrying about funding and burn rate</li>
  <li>Figuring out the go to market strategy</li>
  <li>Negotiating strategic alliances</li>
  <li>Having a conversation with a new hire about something uncomfortable like the fact that they smell and other staffers have complained (this actually happened to me)</li>
  <li>Recruiting the next hire(s)</li>
</ul>

<p>Getting a startup out of Stage Zero means solving a thousand, thousand problems both small and large.  And classical business training says that management is a specialized skill where you get to worry mostly about the big picture.  That simply isn't the case in a Stage Zero startup.</p>
