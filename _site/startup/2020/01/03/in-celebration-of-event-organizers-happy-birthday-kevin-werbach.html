<p class="center">Taken November 20, 2019 which is significant only because that is my birthday</p>

<p>I'm writing this blog post because my Facebook feed just flashed by at me "Today is <strong>Kevin Werbach's</strong> Birthday" and that made me <em>remember</em>.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Werbach">Kevin Werbach</a> is a technology analyst and professor at the Wharton School and someone who is far more important to my life than I ever was to him.  This blog post is a tribute to him because he, through a random act of kindness, had a pretty big impact on my life (and I bet he has never realized this; nor should he).</p>

<p>Back in 2003, I had created the RSS search engine Feedster and had just merged it with RSS-Search which was created by Francois Schiettecatte and he and I, as two nerds do, were trying to figure out "what the hell do we do with this; we have a product and traffic but no business strategy and an ever increasing hosting bill on Scott's credit card that we keep rolling forward each month".  I saw that Kevin had setup the SuperNova conference and I reached out to him and said "I'd love to come but I just can't afford it; help" and Kevin, with absolute graciousness, gave me a free ticket.</p>

<p>I made it down to the DC area for the conference, networked unsuccessfully for a day or two and ended up getting a cab to the airport with Scott Rafer, henceforth referred to as Rafer since I am also a Scott.  A chance thunderstorm stranded Rafer and I at the airport for like 7 hours and during that time I got to know him well enough to ask him to be on our advisory board.  And, shortly there after, I hired Rafer as Feedster's first CEO.  And that hiring led to a whole chain of events detailed below.</p>

<p>So here's the chain of events that Kevin started which, interestingly, lead right up to today:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Kevin gave me a ticket to SuperNova when I couldn't afford one.</li>
  <li>A random meeting led to a colleague and then a CEO.</li>
  <li>Rafer led Feedster's legal formation, office space, hiring and funding efforts.  He made a pile of code into a business.</li>
  <li>We ended up employing a (small) bunch of people and being in business for 3 years.</li>
  <li>Because of Rafer, I ended up having a much larger presence in Silicon Valley than I should have given that I lived in Boston.</li>
  <li>Thanks to my Silicon Valley connections, I got to know a large number of interesting people including Dave Sifry (who at that time was the founder of my biggest competitor, Technorati).</li>
  <li>My work at Feedster led to my getting hired at eduFire which took me into the world of Ruby and Rails and cloud computing.</li>
  <li>I'm still working off a lot of connections I made back in 2003 to 2006.  This includes my current role leading measurement of hate speech for the ADL where I was hired by Dave Sifry (this is now the third time I've taken a role reporting to Dave Sifry).</li>
</ol>

<p>I'd like to pretend that Feedster would have been successful if I hadn't met Rafer but we very much needed capital and meeting Rafer was a strategic inflection point for me.  And that wouldn't have happened without Kevin so <strong>Happy Birthday Kevin</strong>!</p>

<p>And so, in closing, if you are an event organizer, taking a chance on the proverbial little guy sometimes has profound implications for them.</p>
