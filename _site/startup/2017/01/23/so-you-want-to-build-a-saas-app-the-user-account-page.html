  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>So once again I find myself designing a SAAS (software as a service) Account page.  This is the page that represents the user’s account.  Conceptually this should be a pretty simple page – it might have options for updating their billing credentials or changing aspects of their user profile.</p>

<p>This isn’t my first time at this particular rodeo – a SAAS app.  I’ve done this at least twice before.  The last subscription billing system I implemented processed over 13,000 payments and collected over 3.5 million dollars using BrainTree’s API.  And if I was going to follow how I designed this in the past, it would be a piece of cake – I’d implement a simple page that let’s you update your billing credentials and be done with it.</p>

<p>But we’re now in 2017.  The billing system I referenced above I first built in 2010 and <strong>times have changed</strong>.  In specific we now have a much, much better understanding of  the importance of preventing user cancellations.  Users that cancel their accounts wreak havoc on your overall SAAS profitability because you never, ever want to lose a customer.  So if a customer is going to cancel then you at least want to try and address it up front by illustrating the value of your SAAS product to them.</p>

<p>So my initial thinking on this is that you want your Account page to have highlighted at the top an indicator of the value that you are delivering to the user.  And I suspect that if you can actually measure the economic value of what you do then you actually might want to do that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You have used XYZ N times and it has prevented 15 serious errors, 4 minor errors and generated 12 blah for you.  Each of these errors generally takes 3 minutes to resolve so we have saved you over <strong>1 hour</strong> of your very, valuable time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You might also display some metrics about how much data the user has used / stored with your SAAS product.</p>

<p>Given that pretty much all of us use some type of SAAS product these days I thought it might be illustrative to look at the account page for two products: <a href="https://pinboard.in/">PinBoard</a> and <a href="https://gorails.com/">Go Rails</a>.</p>

<p>I am an absolutely unabashed <strong>fan</strong> of both of these products.  PinBoard is a bookmarking service that is actually worth paying for – it rose to prominence when Yahoo decided to shut down Delicious and I’ve been a paying subscriber for the past year.  The founder, Maciej, has an absolutely delightful <a href="https://blog.pinboard.in/">blog</a> and he is ridiculously open about <a href="https://blog.pinboard.in/2014/11/new_pricing_policy/">everything</a>.  GoRails is the philosophical success to Ryan Bates’ RailsCasts and Chris Oliver does a really, really stellar job.  I don’t use it every day but when I need to learn something I hit the <a href="https://gorails.com/episodes">episodes</a> link and it always teaches me something.  Honestly I learned how to work with the Stripe API for this project from Chris.</p>

<p>Here is a picture of the PinBoard account page:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/saas_product_account_page_pinboard.png" alt="pinboard account page" /></p>

<p>I think Maciej did a great, great job on this page.  Every time I look at it I’m reminded of how valuable pinboard can be.  I’m sure there are subtle improvements that could be made but this is greate.</p>

<p>Here are pictures of the GoRails account page.  I had to break it into top and bottom sections since it was higher than the actual screen size.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/saas_product_account_page_gorails_top.png" alt="gorails account page top" /></p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/saas_product_account_page_gorails_bottom.png" alt="gorails account page bottom" /></p>

<p>Even tho this page doesn’t emphasize how valuable GoRails can be, I think that Chris did a great job here.  I specifically like how this page was clearly intentionally designed to minimize support requests for receipts.  I’m going to steal that idea.  When you are running a solo SAAS business, everything needs to be designed to minimize customer support and being able to just say “Click the account link and download any receipt you want” is a nice bit of text to easily send in an email.</p>
