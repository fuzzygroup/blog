<p>While I would happily proclaim that my <strong>ur language</strong> is Ruby, I spend increasingly large amounts of time these days using Python.  And while there are many things that I don't like about Python (the syntax makes my eyes want to weep and then die; thanks <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZGEiz2cpEw">Tim Curry / Psych</a>; around 20 seconds in), the strength of the Python ecosystem is <strong>outstanding</strong>.</p>

<p>Today I'm going to talk about the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html">Python Multiprocessing</a> library which is a standard part of Python and can be used without even needing to install anything.  And this isn't going to be a theoretical explanation of processes / threads / parallelism.  Instead it is going to be a simple explanation about how my favorite Python guru taught me to love the zen of multiprocessing with a very specific example.  But we do need a few basics:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In Python you want to use processes not threads.  The reason for this is the infamous GIL issue which <a href="https://realpython.com/python-gil/">Real Python</a> does a great job discussing so I'm just not going to get into it.</li>
  <li>Unless your python processes are heavily IO bound (example â€“ calling networked APIs), you generally want to use a pool of processes tied to your CPU / Core count.  Happily this is astonishingly trivial as the multiprocessing library gives you multiprocessing.cpu_count() as a core primitive.  Please note that I recognize that I have vastly oversimplified this issue and that many people argue for number of cores - 1.  As with all complex computing issues, well, ymmv.</li>
  <li>Debugging parallel software is always harder than you think it is so I only, ever, do this at the end of project when I <strong>know</strong> that my code works and where the bottlenecks are (i.e. is it IO bound for example).</li>
  <li>Consistency of coding practices makes a huge difference.  In the code base I just left, I was able to transition all of it to a multiprocessing architecture trivially because I had invested heavily in consistency.</li>
  <li>Your deployment tooling makes a huge difference.  If you want to experiment with multiprocessing then you need the ability to change your instance type / number of cores and benchmark to know that you are spending your money wisely.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="before">Before</h2>

<p>Before I implemented multiprocessing, I had an architecture across my data pipeline that looked like this:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">foo</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">bar</span> 

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="c"># do the thing</span>
    
    <span class="c"># do more things</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="after">After</h2>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">multiprocessing</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">foo</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">bar</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">pool</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Pool</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">multiprocessing</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">cpu_count</span><span class="p">())</span>
    <span class="n">res</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">pool</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">apply_async</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">do_main</span><span class="p">)</span> 
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">pass</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">do_main</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="c"># do the thing</span>
    
    <span class="c"># do more things</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>As you can see, do_main is just a rewrite of main() under a different name so it can be called by pool.apply_async().  All I did for this rewrite was:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Import the multiprocessing library.</li>
  <li>Create a new def main() as per the above.</li>
  <li>Rename my former def main() to def do_main().</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="thank-you">Thank You</h2>

<p>I would be remiss without thanking my former colleague Grant for his assistance with this refactor.  It is tremendously easy to go wrong with multiprocessing and he set me straight a number of times.  Thanks Grant!</p>

<h2 id="caveats">Caveats</h2>

<p>The example above isn't doing anything to capture output from the do_main() method.  The reason for this, is that for my use case, I was implementing a data pipeline where my main() method was simply doing work and advancing stuff across the pipeline from SQS bucket to SQS bucket.  If you want to capture output from a do_main() routine then that can be done by reading the documentation for apply_async.</p>
