        <title>A Guideline for Working with SSL Certs You Get From Someone Else</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I think I have a new rule for ssl and it is really, really simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you have to do anything with SSL and the data involved came from someone else then they have to give me an exact, documented process, command lines and all or I’m out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SSL is one of those things that is supposed to be, well, not easy but it shouldn’t be mind numbing either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot count the number of times that people have said to me what amounts to: “Here’s a cert; just make it work”.  It never works cleanly and you know what – &lt;strong&gt;No&lt;/strong&gt;.  Just as an example, I was recently given a “cert” and a “key” and asked to plug them into an AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB).  When I dug more deeply into it, I found:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The cert file actually contained 2 certs.  Sigh.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Neither cert worked with the ELB&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dramatically different errors came up with each cert in the AWS Certificate Manager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m not even saying that this was someone else’s fault.  The sys admin I got these from is both &lt;strong&gt;smart&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;great at his job&lt;/strong&gt;.  What I am saying is that without comprehensive knowledge of SSL, I shouldn’t put time into SSL tasks without full documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think at this point that I’m &lt;strong&gt;done&lt;/strong&gt; taking action on SSL without specific, written steps.  I’m happy to follow someone else’s directions but the 58 million results for “ssl configuration errors” or “ssl aws configuration errors” is, honestly, just too much to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/ssl_configuration_errors.png&quot; alt=&quot;google_ssl_errors&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>20 Days of Zero</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Note: This really is about weight loss and I’ll even show much much I lost but I’m looking at this from a startup context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I generally find people’s second act in the startup world far, far more interesting than people’s first act.  By second act, of course, I am referring to when an entrepreneur tries to replicate the lightning in a bottle experience that they initially had when they built a startup.  Second acts seem to almost always be less successful than people’s first act.  Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Hawkins&quot;&gt;Jeff Hawkins&lt;/a&gt; who built Palm and then Handspring into a multi billion success is now working on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numenta&quot;&gt;Numenta&lt;/a&gt; software that mimic human memory – and he’s been at it for more than a decade&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Charles Ferguson who built Vermeer, the original creators of FrontPage, left high tech entirely and is now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Ferguson_(filmmaker)&quot;&gt;film maker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen&quot;&gt;Marc Andreessen&lt;/a&gt; who created Netscape then created Opsware and is now a Venture capitalist&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rose&quot;&gt;Kevin Rose&lt;/a&gt; founded Digg which although it is much forgotten these days was once upon a time beating Reddit in the social space.  He then did Pownce and is now doing an app called Zero for weight loss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that, dear reader, brings us to Kevin Rose and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@kevinrose/introducing-zero-a-new-app-to-help-you-fast-209935e8245d&quot;&gt;Zero&lt;/a&gt;.  Zero is a new app for what is termed Intermittent Fasting (IF) which is a technique where you fast for a long stretch of the day on an ongoing basis.  Here’s what the app looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/873/1*C9hnNf_51CYUoTl_MFBeYA.png&quot; alt=&quot;Zero App&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve now been using Zero since 1/7 so I have 20 days on it which I think is enough to make some comments.  On 1/7 I weighed in at 194 which isn’t an all time high for me but does reflect, well, post Christmas and Holiday weight gain.  I certainly wasn’t fat by any means but I felt larger than I wanted to be.  After showing my wife Zero we made the joint decision to go on Zero.  My wife suffers from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease&quot;&gt;Celiac disease&lt;/a&gt; in a fairly bad way and by the after Christmas period she was in pretty much constant stomach pain.  Zero, at the time, seemed like a fairly rational decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s my weight metrics, unsophisticated as they are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/weight_metrics.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;weight_metrics.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I started Zero I have lost almost 10 pounds which for a 49 year old man is, I think, fairly good.  The only real goal I had at the start of this was a Gandalf like approach to buying new jeans.  When I found out, post Christmas, that my jeans didn’t fit all that well, I took the position:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Thou Shalt Not Buy Bigger Pants! (Gandalf to a group of fat hobbits)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am happy to report that no new jeans have been purchased and their fit is much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;adding-whole-30-to-zero&quot;&gt;Adding Whole 30 to Zero&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot say that all of this is tied to Zero.  On 1/15 one of my wife’s good friends, H, convinced her to go on &lt;a href=&quot;http://whole30.com/&quot;&gt;Whole 30&lt;/a&gt; and I came along for the chaos.  Whole30 is one of those diets where you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;drink no alcohol&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;no sugar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;no preservatives&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;no dairy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;no corn&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;no carbs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;eat only things you cook yourself&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;eat only meats and vegetables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that I cook everything from scratch already this basically amounted to slight modifications to what I already cook.  I’ve never drank so the alcohol restrictions amounted to “don’t put wine in the beef stew made yesterday” and didn’t affect me at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while I can’t say that all of this is due to Zero, I think the bulk of the weight loss is attributable to the Zero’s Intermittent Fasting approach.  By reducing the window of time during which you can eat down to say 7 to 8 hours, my wife and I have gone from two large meals (lunch and dinner) generally down to 1 (lunch) and a snack (dinner).  So from a weight loss perspective, I suspect the reduction in overall food volume is a bigger contributor than the foods I’ve taken out of my diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I’ve been fairly pleased with Whole 30 as a approach to food.  My wife’s constant stomach pains are gone so that’s a huge win from my perspective.  That was why I agreed to go on it and it has been a complete success in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the Whole 30  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0544854411?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=whole3009c-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0544854411&quot;&gt;cookbook&lt;/a&gt; isn’t all that good.  The recipes fall into that difficult, pretentious category of recipe where my comment would generally be “trying too hard”.  Additionally some of the recipes are flat out either bad or wrong (don’t try to make mayonaise their way; go get &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Food-Lab-Cooking-Through-Science/dp/0393081087/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1485516745&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=kenji+lopez+alt&quot;&gt;Kenji’s book&lt;/a&gt;) or follow &lt;a href=&quot;http://thepioneerwoman.com/food-and-friends/how-to-make-mayonnaise/&quot;&gt;the Pioneer Woman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;comments-on-the-zero-app&quot;&gt;Comments on the Zero App&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Zero app is very much no nonsense – you get a calendar and a few different options for scheduling your fasts and that’s it.  And that’s my biggest problem with it – there’s no way to add your own data to the fast.  I would have very much liked it if say you could attach a picture of each meal you ate to each day.  Or if you could put in a weight metric.  Or if you could put in how you felt.  I’d love to know how many days of Zero it took for my wife to feel better but I have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still Zero led to me losing 10 pounds and that’s nothing to disregard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do get some summary metrics – I can see my average fast time was 16h 49m and that on average I ate for only 6 minutes during the night (I was using the Circadian approach to fasting).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;getting-zero&quot;&gt;Getting Zero&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zero can be gotten from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zero-fasting-tracker/id1168348542?mt=8&quot;&gt;App Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;getting-whole30&quot;&gt;Getting Whole30&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My recommendation would be to just get the baseline &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Whole30-30-Day-Guide-Health-Freedom/dp/0544609719&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; and then ignore their whole philosophy and just focus on the food aspect of it.  Diets, these days, generally seem to be as much guru advice as they are diet and, honestly, I doubt you need a guru.  I know I don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;overall&quot;&gt;Overall&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zero is ridiculously simple to use does make it easy to stick with a fast.  Pairing Zero with Whole30 did seem to produce, at least for me, overall weight loss and, I think, some health gains.  Recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>So You Want to Create a Blog - 2017 Edition</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So my wife just said to me “My sister , Kristi, wants to write a blog” and that’s how this post got started.  It is 2017 and if you want to create a blog, what tool should you use?  The way that I look at it there are four viable tools, among the myriad options, to consider:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blogger&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wordpress&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Medium&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jekyll&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these is discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;blogger&quot;&gt;Blogger&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogger has a venerable position within the blogging world.  Originally the creation of Ev Williams who later went on to create Twitter and Medium, Blogger is really the grandfather of hosted blogging tools.  Currently owned by Google, Blogger is simple, easy to use and probably the quickest way to get started in blogging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All you need to use Blogger is a google account such as a gmail login.  If you want to use Blogger then just click this link:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Visit Blogger] (https://www.blogger.com/about/?r=1-null_user)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a quick step by step walk through of what using Blogger to create a new blog and put a new post on the Internet looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kristisgoatsoap1.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Here’s that one post sample blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;wordpress&quot;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kristisgoatsoap1.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Here’s that one post sample blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;medium&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kristisgoatsoap1.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Here’s that one post sample blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;jekyll&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t create that one post sample blog for Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left Jekyll for last because Jekyll is the hardest tool to use by far&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>S3 Ruby Api Programming Tip</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/ruby_aws_s3.png&quot; alt=&quot;ruby_aws_s3.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I find myself dealing with a backup to a data center that I am decommissioning and while the ultimate backup solution is going to involve hard drives onto which about 6 terabytes of MySQL tables are stored, I want to get at least a sizable portion of this into the cloud as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given my &lt;a href=&quot;http://fuzzyblog.io/blog/aws.html&quot;&gt;public advocacy position&lt;/a&gt; in favor of AWS, S3 is clearly the cloud storage that I’m going to use.  I’ve spent the better part of the past two weeks writing a backup tool, with Nick’s able assistance, that can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;take a large database&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;decompose it into tables&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;dump each table&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;split the tables into manageable size using split&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;gzip those split files&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;move those split files up to s3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;delete its working data as it goes since we only have a fraction of the disc space needed to do this in large (about 10% of the 3 tb for our largest database)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its currently standing at 570 lines of moderately elegant ruby code and its been an interesting exercise in really getting to know how to use the aws-sdk gem and its S3 functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a quick overview of the steps in using the S3 gem with Ruby under Linux. You should note that all of this has been done in the context of a command line tool under straight ruby.  I suspect its directly portable to Rails but I haven’t tested that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start by installing the AWS cli with: &lt;strong&gt;sudo apt-get install awscli&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Configure your credentials with: &lt;strong&gt;aws configure&lt;/strong&gt;.  This writes a ~/.aws/credentials file that the ruby gem knows how to read.  And that’s brilliant because the credentials then are NOT stored in your code and can’t be leaked through a repo becoming public.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Since you’re missing Rails and the dynamic include structure, you have to do load the gem with these two statements: **gem ‘aws-sdk’; require ‘aws-sdk’; **&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You have to create an s3 instance with a command like this: &lt;strong&gt;@s3 = Aws::S3::Resource.new(region:’us-west-2’)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the official documentation on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/Aws/S3/Object.html&quot;&gt;s3 instance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that you can call methods like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;obj = @s3.bucket(bucket).object(name_in_s3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as the variables bucket and name_in_s3 are set this will return back to you an instance that you can work with.  The mistake that I made was trying to get the size of an object with .content_length when the underlying data had not yet been transferred up to S3.  I was testing the existence of the object with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;if obj&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;after I had created the object and I assumed that it was ensuring that the object already existed.  In fact what I needed to do was this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;remote_size = obj.content_length if obj.exists?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for this is apparent if you &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; about it.  You have to build the object in order to transfer data to it so you’re going to have an actual object before you even transfer the data.  This reminds me so, very very vividly of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/&quot;&gt;Spolsky on Leaky Abstractions&lt;/a&gt; and his 2002 rant on why you don’t abstract long running network operations and try and make them be exactly the same as fast running local operations.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rails Tutorial - Making Font Awesome Work with Rails 5</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Like a lot of back end folks I suspect I’m not alone when I look at a project like Font Awesome and go “Great Work; damn if I know how to actually use that.”  I’d normally toss it over the wall to a front end guy like my buddy &lt;a href=&quot;http://dv2.dasari.me&quot;&gt;Dv&lt;/a&gt; but this is for my side project so I’m all alone on this one.  Since I really, really don’t feel that I understand the world of front end work and CSS / SCSS very well I thought I’d write it all down for you (and myself).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;heres-what-not-to-do&quot;&gt;Here’s what not to do&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a number of wrong steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I watched this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RC_jIGABW-E&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; and it is really good – except for the specific steps he gave me didn’t work.  I really don’t understand why and it might have been me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/FortAwesome/font-awesome-sass&quot;&gt;font-awesome-sass gem&lt;/a&gt; and it too failed me hard.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t follow the Stack Overflow post &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37581599/rails-assets-is-having-issues-with-my-fonts&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all of the above cases I got the error &lt;strong&gt;No route matches [GET] “/assets/fontawesome-webfont.ttf”&lt;/strong&gt; and I just couldn’t get past it.  The Stack Overflow post might have ultimately gotten me there but it did take me to a different gem – font-awesome-rails discussed in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should note that I don’t meant to malign any of the urls in the above material – I’m not a css / front end guy by any means.  All I did was some simple googles and the processes I was taken through ultimately didn’t work and I blew over an hour of development time to find that out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;heres-what-to-do&quot;&gt;Here’s What To Do&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you actually need is to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bokmann/font-awesome-rails&quot;&gt;font-awesome-rails&lt;/a&gt; gem.  Just add &lt;strong&gt;gem “font-awesome-rails”&lt;/strong&gt; to your Gemfile and then do the bundle install dance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In your application.css.scss file add the line: &lt;strong&gt;@import “font-awesome”;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stop and start your rails server.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add to a test .html.erb view file this line**: fa_icon “camera-retro” ** (you’ll probably need to enclose that in output tags using %= and angle braces)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Render that test .html.erb view file in your browser and you should see a camera icon.  What this is doing behind the scenes is outputting this html: &lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-camera-retro&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;useful-resources&quot;&gt;Useful Resources&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some important urls:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fontawesome.io/icons/&quot;&gt;The Icon Search Page for Font Awesome&lt;/a&gt; - Use this to search for the icon you need.  This is the most useful page on their site.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fontawesome.io/&quot;&gt;Font Awesome Home Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bokmann/font-awesome-rails&quot;&gt;Font Awesome Rails Gem&lt;/a&gt; -&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome&quot;&gt;The Font Awesome Github Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fontawesome.io/cheatsheet/&quot;&gt;The Cheat Sheet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12468359/using-font-awesome-icon-for-bullet-points-with-a-single-list-item-element&quot;&gt;Useful Example of Font Awesome at the HTML Level&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fontawesome.io/icon/search/&quot;&gt;Example of Using the Search Icon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fontawesome.io/examples/&quot;&gt;The General Examples Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fontawesome.io/get-started/&quot;&gt;The Getting Started Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>How to Handle Your Personal Taxes when You Are Startup Folk</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Please note the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is a U.S. centric post; I don’t know how taxes work anywhere but here&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This post assumes that you have an accountant to help you&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This post documents what I personally had to go through on 1/23/17 to get my personal deductions together and I wrote it, honestly, because next year I’ll have to go thru the same process and this is the first time since 1987 that I feel good about the process I used.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I am not an account and you should really talk to your own accountant.  This is the process that I have followed for years and since this year I actually did it well, I thought it was worth sharing.  Taking tax advice from a stranger on the Internet, well, your mileage may vary (YMMV).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you fall into that vague category of &lt;em&gt;startup folk&lt;/em&gt; – entrepreneurs, founding engineers, etc – organizing your personal taxes is a bloody disaster.  I spend money all year long that should generally fall into the category of business deductions.  Normally I don’t pay all that much attention and just treat it as a loss.  This year I’ve got some additional tax concerns so I actually got serious and really &lt;strong&gt;itemized hard&lt;/strong&gt;.  Here’s how I did it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-you-need&quot;&gt;What You Need&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what you need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Access to every single email account that you used where a receipt might accumulate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Access to all the online services that don’t always send receipts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;File folders&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Paper&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pen&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Willpower; this is an incredibly draining process&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A printer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;reminder---use-the-gmail-and-amazon-print-view&quot;&gt;Reminder - Use the gmail and Amazon Print View&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are printing stuff from gmail you should use the printer icon to get a print view.  This renders much better when it is available and uses less paper.  There is also a specific print view for Amazon orders that is better than the default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-brief-tax-rant&quot;&gt;A Brief Tax Rant&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taxes are my least favorite thing in the whole wide world.  I find the U.S. tax code byzantine in its complexity and entirely unfair.  As I see it, the core principles of taxation are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everyone should contribute&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taxes should be understandable by everyone since they are imposed on everyone&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Every dollar should flow through the tax mill once and only once&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. tax code violates every one of these core taxation concepts.  Now, that said, it is important to note that while I don’t like it, I also believe in being 100% honest and I never want to be audited so the trick here is meticulous documentation.  There is nothing wrong with a $2.31 AWS bill being deductible – but you have to document it.  That’s why #8 above is a printer – I made physical paper copies of every single expense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-1-create-a-physical-artifact-for-each-expense-category&quot;&gt;Step 1: Create a Physical Artifact For Each Expense Category&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taxes are important because if you screw them up, the tax man can make your life a living hell.  My father has been audited, every year, for over a decade.  And nothing ever happens to him but, to my mind, that’s flying far too close to the sun.  And when something is as important as taxes then you handle it with a physical artifact because physical artifacts last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first step was to create a representation of each category.  In my case that was a single sheet of white printer paper with the category name on it.  So I had a stack of pages like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hardware&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Software&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Office Supplies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Online Services&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Conferences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-2-write-down-what-you-remember&quot;&gt;Step 2: Write Down What You Remember&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is that you want to write down on each representation what you remember as big ticket items.  So, for example, I wrote down these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hardware&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Intel NUC&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Dell Widescreen Monitor&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Software&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Ruby Motion&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conferences&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Elixir Con&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect that these few expenses covered maybe 70% of my year.  And by writing them down I’m at least guaranteeing that I’ll look for them.  When you’re a member of the startup tribe, well, life is fast paced and it is easy to forget about things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-3-start-with-email&quot;&gt;Step 3: Start with Email&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take your first email account and run a search for the keyword &lt;strong&gt;receipt&lt;/strong&gt;.  You might also, if you use gmail, want to look at your purchases label that Google sets up for you.  You will find that this process is exhausting because you are likely going to look at hundreds of different emails.  As you find each receipt then:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Print it out&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put it in the right category&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add it to a tally sheet or a spreadsheet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the key idea – &lt;strong&gt;nothing is too small&lt;/strong&gt;.  If you bought a $10 USB stick and it was actually for business yes, well, then you should deduct it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to do this for every single email account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-4-access-every-ongoing-online-service&quot;&gt;Step 4: Access Every Ongoing Online Service&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the era of cloud services, we all have a frightening amount of monthly fees.  What you want to do here is log into each one and get a print out of either each receipt or the main receipt index.  Here’s an example from the outstandingly good GoRails site:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/go_rails_invoicing.png&quot; alt=&quot;go_rails_invoicing.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On your Online Services page you want to add a entry for “Go Rails” (or whatever) and then a total ($51) and a date (2016).  You need to do this for every single online service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-5-review-every-single-thing-from-amazon&quot;&gt;Step 5: Review Every Single Thing from Amazon&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the big, hard one.  Amazon does a brilliant job of making your order information available to you and that is excellent but you still have to go thru it yourself and remember “Ok that hard drive – was that for my kid’s Xbox or is it on my desk?”.  But, if you are anything like me, you’ll find that there are a lot of small business purchases lumped in with your personal purchases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use Amazon a lot then you’ll find that you have a large number of orders to sort thru.  I had &lt;strong&gt;41&lt;/strong&gt; pages of orders to sort through for the year of 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-6-aws&quot;&gt;Step 6: AWS&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t find many, if any, receipts for AWS in my email so I logged into my AWS console separately and went thru that manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-7-think-hard-and-iterate-again&quot;&gt;Step 7: Think Hard and Iterate Again&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final step here is actually the hardest – you need to think and think hard about what you did over an entire year and what might actually be tax deductible.  It is almost certain that you will have forgotten something so think long and hard.  If you come up with something then follow the process above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-8-the-result&quot;&gt;Step 8: The Result!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the process here’s what the floor of my office looked like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/tax_hell.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;tax_hell.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I have to do now is summarize the tally sheet on top and give it to my accountant.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>So You Want to Build a SAAS App - The User Account Page</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So once again I find myself designing a SAAS (software as a service) Account page.  This is the page that represents the user’s account.  Conceptually this should be a pretty simple page – it might have options for updating their billing credentials or changing aspects of their user profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t my first time at this particular rodeo – a SAAS app.  I’ve done this at least twice before.  The last subscription billing system I implemented processed over 13,000 payments and collected over 3.5 million dollars using BrainTree’s API.  And if I was going to follow how I designed this in the past, it would be a piece of cake – I’d implement a simple page that let’s you update your billing credentials and be done with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we’re now in 2017.  The billing system I referenced above I first built in 2010 and &lt;strong&gt;times have changed&lt;/strong&gt;.  In specific we now have a much, much better understanding of  the importance of preventing user cancellations.  Users that cancel their accounts wreak havoc on your overall SAAS profitability because you never, ever want to lose a customer.  So if a customer is going to cancel then you at least want to try and address it up front by illustrating the value of your SAAS product to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my initial thinking on this is that you want your Account page to have highlighted at the top an indicator of the value that you are delivering to the user.  And I suspect that if you can actually measure the economic value of what you do then you actually might want to do that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You have used XYZ N times and it has prevented 15 serious errors, 4 minor errors and generated 12 blah for you.  Each of these errors generally takes 3 minutes to resolve so we have saved you over &lt;strong&gt;1 hour&lt;/strong&gt; of your very, valuable time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might also display some metrics about how much data the user has used / stored with your SAAS product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that pretty much all of us use some type of SAAS product these days I thought it might be illustrative to look at the account page for two products: &lt;a href=&quot;https://pinboard.in/&quot;&gt;PinBoard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gorails.com/&quot;&gt;Go Rails&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am an absolutely unabashed &lt;strong&gt;fan&lt;/strong&gt; of both of these products.  PinBoard is a bookmarking service that is actually worth paying for – it rose to prominence when Yahoo decided to shut down Delicious and I’ve been a paying subscriber for the past year.  The founder, Maciej, has an absolutely delightful &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.pinboard.in/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; and he is ridiculously open about &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.pinboard.in/2014/11/new_pricing_policy/&quot;&gt;everything&lt;/a&gt;.  GoRails is the philosophical success to Ryan Bates’ RailsCasts and Chris Oliver does a really, really stellar job.  I don’t use it every day but when I need to learn something I hit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gorails.com/episodes&quot;&gt;episodes&lt;/a&gt; link and it always teaches me something.  Honestly I learned how to work with the Stripe API for this project from Chris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a picture of the PinBoard account page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/saas_product_account_page_pinboard.png&quot; alt=&quot;pinboard account page&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Maciej did a great, great job on this page.  Every time I look at it I’m reminded of how valuable pinboard can be.  I’m sure there are subtle improvements that could be made but this is greate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are pictures of the GoRails account page.  I had to break it into top and bottom sections since it was higher than the actual screen size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/saas_product_account_page_gorails_top.png&quot; alt=&quot;gorails account page top&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/saas_product_account_page_gorails_bottom.png&quot; alt=&quot;gorails account page bottom&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even tho this page doesn’t emphasize how valuable GoRails can be, I think that Chris did a great job here.  I specifically like how this page was clearly intentionally designed to minimize support requests for receipts.  I’m going to steal that idea.  When you are running a solo SAAS business, everything needs to be designed to minimize customer support and being able to just say “Click the account link and download any receipt you want” is a nice bit of text to easily send in an email.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>If I Was a Traveling Musician</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My friend David Rovics, on his blog and email newsletter, &lt;a href=&quot;http://songwritersnotebook.blogspot.com/2017/01/why-do-they-keep-begging.html&quot;&gt;laments the loss of CDs as a revenue stream for the traveling musician&lt;/a&gt;.  I’m not a traveling musician but I suspect that he is absolutely right.  As I gaze across my desk of computing hardware:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/my_desk.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;my_desk.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there is only 1 device capable of playing CDs and it is a 2010 era MacBook Pro (it is actually in a stand behind everything so even tho it can play CDs, I can’t reach the slot easily).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re at all interested in the indie music scene / folk music / songs of protest then &lt;a href=&quot;http://songwritersnotebook.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;David&lt;/a&gt; is a fascinating read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;: David is a friend and he and I grew up together.  We don’t share a wit of political ideology - he is as far left as it gets and I’m a staunch startup / technology believer but America was built on people being allowed to disagree and it all making us stronger.  If I want to be able to believe what I hold dear then he &lt;strong&gt;has&lt;/strong&gt; to be able to believe as he chooses.  In these divisive times it feels like this has been forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, David is making the point that CDs don’t sell like they used to and that makes his touring much, much harder since a key revenue source has diminished.  He terms it a post-CD reality and, yep – that makes sense.  People aren’t buying the discs, I suspect, because outside of the car they don’t have a way to play them.  Why should you buy them if you can’t play them?  And I know the feeling because I belong to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davidrovics.com/subscribe/&quot;&gt;David’s Community Supported Art (CSA)&lt;/a&gt; program and I just got a batch of CDs recently.  And I know that I put them right in the car.  But even there, they &lt;strong&gt;may not&lt;/strong&gt; get played - most of my music in the car comes from either a USB stick or XM Radio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: I think that a touring musician offering a physical artifact like a CD for sale is a great thing.  People do spend money for physical artifacts to support an artist but I suspect that they won’t spend money when they flat out can’t use it at all.  Just for example, there’s only 1 other CD player in our whole house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;sidebar-the-miracle-of-things-being-10x-easier&quot;&gt;Sidebar: The Miracle of Things Being 10x Easier&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the tenets of the technology world that I’ve always believed is that when you make something literally &lt;em&gt;10x easier to use&lt;/em&gt; then it is a f&lt;em&gt;undamentally different&lt;/em&gt; thing.  As an example, I’ve recently been experimenting quite a bit with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-Bluetooth-Speaker-with-WiFi-Alexa/dp/B00X4WHP5E&quot;&gt;Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt; / Alexa service.  My test case for it is actually playing music and even though I’m not really a music person, with Alexa, the simple fact that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I don’t have to mess with my phone&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I don’t have to fight with BlueTooth pairing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I don’t have to screw with iTunes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I don’t have to plug in a cable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I don’t have to pick from a library of thousands of tracks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I can say “Alexa play the doors”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;makes a music playing experience that is literally &lt;strong&gt;10x easier than a CD&lt;/strong&gt; (CDs get lost, damaged, don’t always have metadata, need to be imported into iTunes, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;so-what-is-easier-than-a-cd&quot;&gt;So What is Easier than a CD?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer here to my mind is simple – &lt;strong&gt;a USB stick&lt;/strong&gt; dramatically improves on the listening experience:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It works in almost any computer out of the box (with new Macintoshes it needs a dongle)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Even a cheap 4 gig USB stick can hold tons of music&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is an advertising / promotion opportunity to lower your costs by allowing other artists music to be on there&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Songs can be easily dragged into iTunes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Metadata and album art could actually be correct&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with a USB stick is that it is &lt;strong&gt;static&lt;/strong&gt; and indie musicians are constantly making new music – even I know that’s part of the attraction.  A low volume artist like David doesn’t want to invest in say 100 usb sticks and then find that they are out of date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that brings us to the next section, My Proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;my-proposal-for-touring-musicians&quot;&gt;My Proposal for Touring Musicians&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think what touring musicians should sell is a USB stick which has the following features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A Small Music Archive like a Best of David Rovics album&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A program which updates the USB stick from the Internet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A readme file that basically amounts to “Run the update program”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The update program would be a small executable that connects to a source on the Internet and downloads a full archive complete with album art and metadata.  People could the plug that into their computer, take that to their car, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could call this &lt;em&gt;USB Stick as Platform&lt;/em&gt; perhaps.  The software could easily be written in JavaScript using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://electron.atom.io/&quot;&gt;Electron&lt;/a&gt; toolkit.  If &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.com/downloads/&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; can ship versions of their app for OSX, Windows and Linux off the same code base and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atom.io&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; can do the same then there should be no problem developing a pretty simple downloader.  All it has to do is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read a config file which determines the source url to read from&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start downloading songs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Store the songs in a rational file hierarchy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Display a progress bar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you wanted to you could get fancy like embed an encrypted token in the config file that limits how many downloads but I wouldn’t recommend it.  I think Simple is better here.  I would allow for it pulling down some advertising style content since that would give a musician the ability to promote an upcoming concert, cross promote another artist, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end result of this is that the musician could give to a manufacturer like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flashbay.com/usb-music-distribution&quot;&gt;FlashBay&lt;/a&gt; a master USB stick and get back say 100.  I don’t know the prices on them but if you promoted it properly like “David Rovics USB Library” and it could perpetually update itself then you’d have something that actually might have  dramatically higher price than a single CD.  You’d need to test pricing but my gut says that a USB stick of this nature could easily fetch $20 or more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-final-note&quot;&gt;A Final Note&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my last &lt;a href=&quot;http://fuzzyblog.io/blog/rant/2016/12/20/david-rovics-community-supported-art-or-a-tale-of-paywoe.html&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; that referenced David, I failed to define some terms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;UI - user interface – the look, feel and interactions a user has with a product&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;UX - user experience – the overall experience that a user has with a given product&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;UI/UX - the fusion of the two&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My apologies for leaving these out.  As a card carrying member of the technology tribe, I do exist in a world of acronyms and I sometimes don’t realize that they are not clear to others.&lt;/p&gt;
