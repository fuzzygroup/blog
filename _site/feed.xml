        <title>Good Riddance to Zoom or Video Conferencing Is Still Not the Future</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past 11 months or so I’ve had the opportunity to fairly regularly use a video conferencing tool known as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zoom.us&quot;&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt; and I’m finally rid of it and &lt;strong&gt;thank heavens&lt;/strong&gt;.  Ever since I stopped using it, I’m free of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;absolute CPU killing performance; now that I am not using it any more, my machine is fast again&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the requirement to always have a shirt on - I work from home and my office gets hot at times&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;getting nattered at about not always facing the camera; I have multiple machines so I can get work done while video conferencing is running&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;constant log in and log out issues when you have multiple machines like, oh I don’t know - iPhone, iPad, laptop; not an uncommon use case now a days.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;its many user interface idiocies including the fact that they want you have a “zoom number” which is like a phone number without the chunking.  So if you have to type it in manually, which for me happens constantly, you have to try and read this:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/zoom.png&quot; alt=&quot;zoom.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stupidest thing of all on this last point is that the damn system understands a chunked phone number because it formats the number for you when you type it in.  Why they can’t generate the url like this: http://zoom.us/j/649-428-379 and then just throw away the dashes, I do not know.  The whole reason the US has area codes is because of &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.screensteps.com/chunking-information&quot;&gt;chunking and its not hard to understand&lt;/a&gt;.  Even if we’re not trying to remember it permanently, its easier to visually see and type it in. Why don’t I want to use the link?  Well I’m a developer and my calendar isn’t always on the box where I want to take a video call.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Software Engineering Learnings - What Wolfram Arnold Taught Me</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The year was 2007 and the month was August.  I had just joined eduFire and we made the decision at a corporate level that despite my technical expertise being in anything but Rails, we were going to move all of our development efforts to Rails.  Thankfully I did have Ruby experience but Rails was new to me so we brought in a consultant, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/wolframarnold&quot;&gt;Wolfram Arnold&lt;/a&gt;, to bring me up to speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can easily be familiar with something intellectually and still have it throw you.  Sure I knew what &lt;strong&gt;pair programming&lt;/strong&gt; was – I’d read the Ward Cunningham stuff but I’d never done it.  And I’d certainly never done it intensively as we proceeded to do for the next month.  I suspect to my dying day,  I will never forget my very first day with Wolf.  I’d been working on my own for a few weeks at this point and I’d cobbled together an authentication system for our educational application.  Within the first fifteen minutes he looked at it and then with, teutonic precision, he said to me “&lt;em&gt;And now we’ll throw all this away.&lt;/em&gt;”  I was absolutely flummoxed but when you hire a consultant, if you’re not going to trust them, then why did you hire them?  So over the next 30 days or so, Wolfram taught me rails, pairing and test driven development (tdd).  Oh and that code throw away thing?  He was right.  Damn it.  ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tossing out your new boss’ work on your very first day, even if you are a consultant, that takes guts.  And it was the right call but it was still gutsy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here’s what Wolfram Arnold taught me: &lt;strong&gt;Pair Programming Works&lt;/strong&gt; or what is also known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_Law&quot;&gt;Linus’ Law&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;With enough eyes, all bugs are shallow&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pair programming is one of those absolutely uncomfortable experiences that’s absolutely good for you.  I’ve now been pairing for years and years so I’m used to it but when you’re just starting out, you feel like an idiot having someone watch you stumble through things.  Pair programming, imho, remains the single best way to get a new hire up to speed on a code base.  And because the cost of fixing a bug is &lt;strong&gt;directly proportional&lt;/strong&gt; to amount of time that lapses from when a bug was created, I can make a pretty solid argument that two man teams are much more effective than solo developers. If a bug never gets into the code base in the first place then fixing it has effectively zero cost.  When we developed eduFire, we took the practices that Wolfram drilled into me and we ran development almost exclusively as a paired thing for the next two years.  I don’t think I’ve ever had such a well tested, stable code base. We used to average about 90% to 95% test coverage on any given day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pairing wasn’t the only thing I learned from Wolfram, Rails itself was an eye opener and tdd changed everything for me.  I’ve always felt that tdd was what let me describe myself as “Software Engineer” instead of “Coder” but pair programming fundamentally changed my perspective on software engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Startup Learnings - What Scott Rafer Taught Me</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I founded Feedster in 2003, I always knew that I wasn’t the CEO.  Sure – I could blog and communicate well – but I didn’t want to raise money and, in a startup, that’s the CEO’s job.  Also I was in Boston at the time, 2003, and in those days the funding climate was much better on the West Coast so Feedster was always going to be a West Coast company.  The only thing I didn’t know was the how.  That happened at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.supernovagroup.net&quot;&gt;1st SuperNova Conference&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Werbach&quot;&gt;Kevin Werbach&lt;/a&gt;.  Since I was a poor, unfunded startup, ok technology experiment at that point, Kevin very graciously comped me a pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At SuperNova, I met &lt;a href=&quot;http://rafer.net&quot;&gt;Scott Rafer&lt;/a&gt; and, as I wrote in my first blogging tool,  &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio-weblogs.com/0103807/2003/07/10.html#a1871&quot;&gt;radio.weblogs.com&lt;/a&gt;,we ended up sharing a ride to the airport.  Thanks to crappy weather, the airport was socked in and he and I hung out for about six hours.  Not too long after that Scott agreed to be an informal adviser to Feedster.  And not long after that I asked him to be the CEO and run the business side of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here’s what Scott Rafer taught me:  &lt;strong&gt;always be nice everyone but be particularly nice to the little guy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scott was experienced, smart as a whip and had been around the high tech block more than a few times.  But despite that, he was unfailingly polite to anyone and everyone - waiters, taxi cab drivers, etc.  There wasn’t a hint of “silicon valley arrogance” in him and I made the decision to hire him, to a large extent, based on that.  I knew that he had the personal background and credentials that I wanted but, when you start a company, you need to expect that there will be bad times as well as good times.  Generally there are more bad times than good so character matters.  And I’ve never found &lt;strong&gt;good manners&lt;/strong&gt; without &lt;strong&gt;good character&lt;/strong&gt;.  Anyone can be polite to other people in a socially upward context but it takes both grace and humility to be nice to everyone.  Its easy to be nice to people when they can do something for you.  So this one thing told me a huge amount about Scott Rafer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now to be honest this isn’t anything I didn’t already know.  My mom taught me this.  So did my father and my grandfather.  I had it drilled into me from a very early age, as you always do, when you grow up working retail.  But even when you already know something you can learn it again.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Keeps You From Using Using Elixir</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So I’m at roughly 35,000 feet coming back from ElixirCon, and I saw a tweet that sparked my interest: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/georgeguimaraes/status/771722738994180096&quot;&gt;What Keeps You from Using Elixir?&lt;/a&gt;.  Wow.  That’s a fantastic question.  I’d like to break that down to three issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Elixir Language&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Phoenix Framework&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deployment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ecosystem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the right question to ask and I believe that the author works for Platformatec so this is effectively market research for them and I’m delighted to answer at least for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally I’m a hard core rubyist.  I’ve been using Ruby since 2006 and Rails since 2007.  I’m responsible for a pure ruby codebase doing hardcore data processing at a very large scale (6,000,000 data points per day) for one application / 1/4 terabyte of crawled data per month for another application. Our aggregate code base is approaching 500,000 lines of code in total and the design pattern is, well, the all too familiar &lt;strong&gt;Ruby Monolith&lt;/strong&gt;.  I came to ElixirCon because the tooling I’ve devoted over a decade to simply can’t cut it anymore.  Its is the fragility that all of us know all too well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;brittle gem stack (but better than Node)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;test coverage that runs slowing, inconsistently if at all&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;performance issues that range from annoying to dreadful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now don’t get me wrong – I actually do love ruby but I no longer feel like I can build stable, reliable distributed systems with it.  And, honestly, the less reliable my systems are the less time I can get with my wife and kids.  After over a decade of ruby, the failures just aren’t fun anymore.  I go into work and it feels, too often, like I’m an architect building something on a foundation of wet sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally I’ve been experimenting with Elixir now since &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/blog/elixir/2016/03/05/getting-started-installation.html&quot;&gt;March 5, 2016&lt;/a&gt; and I still don’t have anything save toys so, now with the context in place, let’s talk about the issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d draw a firm distinction between the Elixir language and the phoenix framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;elixir&quot;&gt;Elixir&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting going with a new language in production is &lt;strong&gt;hard&lt;/strong&gt;.  And its particularly hard when the language breaks with existing paradigms and then leverages other technology (Erlang).  You end up having to master a language and then master the other technology.  And even if you don’t have to master Erlang to use Elixir you do have to be able to get it running and feel comfortable with it in a production context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for most of us, I think the issue comes down to finding that perfect penetration point.  The killer app which the language is really good for.  Its taken me six months to figure that out for my organization and I finally have it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe Platformatec needs to work on a twitter campaign like #MyElixirKillerApp and get people talking about what they want to use Elixir for.  We all just saw #MyElixirStatus do quite well over the past few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;phoenix&quot;&gt;Phoenix&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phoenix is interesting as heck to me although Chris McCord’s presentation yesterday on changes to the layout does make me a bit apprehensive.  Knowing that major changes are coming to the layout makes me mildly concerned about starting work on it today – although I did start on an application before I boarded this plane.  Honestly the single biggest thing that concerns me about Phoenix is having to write the authentication layer myself.  I’m hard pressed to think of anything I’ve built in the last 5 if not 10 years that didn’t have login as part of it.  So the concept that I have to roll my own authentication for Phoenix when I know that Devise comes from the parents of Elixir really bothers me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And don’t get me wrong, I know that I can build a simple password form and use Comeonin for hashing.  And it doesn’t even have to be Devise but I’m very reluctant to implement security in what is to me a brand new language and brand new framework.  I’m too damn likely to screw something up and leave a hole.  I don’t have to have all the features of Devise but I really feel like this out to be a provided facility and not something that we all implement poorly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sidebar:&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t even like Devise; I struggle with it regularly but I trust their understanding of security better than my own.  The guy who &lt;a href=&quot;https://fuzzygroup.github.io/blog/software%20engineering/2016/09/02/what-wolfram-arnold-taught-me.html&quot;&gt;taught me rails&lt;/a&gt; drilled this into me when I started and its as good advice now as it was then.  People who exploit security holes are scary good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;deployment&quot;&gt;Deployment&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should admit that I couldn’t make the deployment presentation at ElixirConf so perhaps the answer as at the conference and I missed it.  The state of deployment for an Elixir / Phoenix “thing” bothers me.  I know that I can develop in it but I don’t fully understand how I regularly get this into my daily code / fix / release workflow.  I do know that the state of Ruby deployment in the early days was poor and that makes me think that things aren’t all that different.  And perhaps the answer is that classical deployment is irrelevant and all this needs to be done at the container level. If so then that’s another issue since not all of us are fully conversant with containers yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;ecosystem&quot;&gt;Ecosystem&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all the bashing of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really, really want to use Elixir / Phoenix.  Ever since the first day, picking up my rails apps has&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ElixirCon Review and Closing Thoughts</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As I write this, ElixirCon is winding down and I have to just say &lt;strong&gt;thank you&lt;/strong&gt; to the organizers.  This was a &lt;strong&gt;fantastic conference&lt;/strong&gt; and worth every single penny.  I spent my own money on this and I still feel it was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some closing thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Elixir 2016 feels a lot like Ruby in 2006 or Rails roughly version 3; it feels like it is about to explode and this is a great time to jump on the bandwagon.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The 1.3 directory structure changes in Phoenix actually do concern me a lot.  Chris has shown wonderful design sense so far so I have to trust him but rejiggering the overall directory structure always wreaks havoc on existing code.  We’ll have to see.  It does make me, however, want to defer starting on new Phoenix code until it comes out.  I have some command line Elixir tools, however, that I can start on.  Chris also made some comments about the generators and I would be very sorry to see them go as they are currently &lt;strong&gt;excellent&lt;/strong&gt;.  Sonny also didn’t teach the generators at all in the Phoenix class which makes me wonder.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Surprisingly the Presence / Channels in Phoenix, which I really have undervalued, I can see offer some really interesting opportunities particularly in building admin tools that keep you up to date on the status of a running system.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DRY is no longer the underlying rule of the day.  Sonny, in the Phoenix training course, showed us the use of error_tag: at the level of each form field instead of a UL / LI loop at the top of the form.  Not having someone natter to me about DRY was really shocking.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dialyzer looks to be a wonderful tool.  The Riak guy who gave the presentation was impressive. (Note - you can generally ignore the &lt;em&gt;no local return&lt;/em&gt; message and and go to the next error)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The single best session I attended was the Leveling Up Your Ecto session; just outstanding!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A lot of presenters went a bit too fast or to shallow at the level.  At a conference like this you don’t need to be told how to use anything; you should be told how it works.  YMMV but that’s my opinion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The donut to human ratio (DHR) on the Thursday coffee session was &lt;strong&gt;excellent&lt;/strong&gt; and seemed to be at least 1:1 if not 1.5 to 1.  Sadly Friday’s coffee was ruled by healthy muffins and fruit salad reflecting a &lt;em&gt;DHR of 0&lt;/em&gt;.  The afternoon food on Friday was similarly healthy.  &lt;strong&gt;Unacceptable!&lt;/strong&gt;  ;-)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I haven’t spent time with multiple arities since an AI course in 1986 (Quintus prolog on a Sun 3).  Seeing /1, /2. /3 all over the place generated college nostalgia.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m not certain that I agree with Amy Tan’s learning presentation that its best to start with Elixir and then do Phoenix.  Elixir is very abstract where as the web, Phoenix, is concrete.  Learning tastes vary but I don’t think she is 100% right on this one.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Elixir is now all over the place.  I’ve met people from close to every state as well as a whole bunch of different countries.  For the first time in a long time I met more people at a tech conference that weren’t from the bay area.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deployment is still kind of a mess.  It does appear, however, that people are packaging up their Elixir into containers and then deploying the containers.  Maybe this signals an end to native deployment?  Given the shite show that Rails deployment has been for years I can ‘t say that I’m sorry.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kubernetes is real and actually being used much to my surprise.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unlike a lot of recent technology conferences where I always feel like the old guy in the room, here I felt just like one of the crowd.  There are a ton of, ahem, “more senior”, guys still writing code and since I’m one of them, that feels great.  Makes sense – reliability appeals a lot more when you know that there’s more to life than grinding out code / ops issues.  What’s fun in your 20s is drudgery by your 40s.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The composition of the attendees varied but it generally seemed to be “erlang experts bemused by all this (the Get off my Beam Slide!)” or Rubyists who are just plain at the breaking point.  I’m not here because I dislike Ruby – I’m here because I no longer believe that Ruby / Rails can actually improve to meet my needs.  Every rubyist I talked to had a similar story including the two guys I rode to the airport with.  Do I love the Elixir syntax?  Do I feel that is as elegant and beautiful as Ruby can be?  Right now, no.  Do I feel absolutely certain that it can be more &lt;strong&gt;reliable&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;scalable&lt;/strong&gt; than Ruby?  1,000%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I met a ton of great people.  Thank you all.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;tooople NOT tuple as I have always pronounced it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;__ = dunder (double underscore)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Great tshirts!  They even gave me an extra one for my wife when I asked nicely which was very, very classy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;structs, tuples, lists and maps oh my!  I need to dig out the books and knock out some study.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Startup Learnings - What Matt Mullenweg Taught Me</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress, today, is an unquestioned king of the Internet.  I just checked the stats and WP 4.6 has been downloaded over &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/download/counter/&quot;&gt;7 million times&lt;/a&gt; (and you can watch the number increase).  I remember, however, a time when its dominance wasn’t so clear – I remember being at the launch party for either &lt;a href=&quot;https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Versions&quot;&gt;.72 or 1.0&lt;/a&gt; when things weren’t so clear.  But I suspect that I’m rambling now – long day.  Anyway, even when WP’s ascendancy wasn’t so clear, I always thought that &lt;a href=&quot;https://ma.tt/&quot;&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/a&gt; himself was the real deal. He clearly knew what he was doing and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg&quot;&gt;his history since 2004&lt;/a&gt; certainly bears that out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the very early days of WordPress.com I remember talking to Matt about how they were handling the database implementation and he told me that WordPress.com was just architected just like WordPress itself – a single database per user.  I looked at that decision, to myself, a bit aghast.  After all, I was a &lt;em&gt;software developer&lt;/em&gt;, so I knew that you had only a single database per application.  Boy was I wrong.  At the time I had a traditional software guy’s perspective on the database – big, expensive, resource intensive – so you limited the database’s use.  However, I suspect, Matt looked at the database from the perspective of shared hosting.  Hosting companies routinely run thousands, if not tens of thousands of databases, on boxes to support customers on cheap hosting.  And, if they could do it, why couldn’t he?  And what a damn brilliant decision that was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;By logically isolating each customer’s data from the other, he utterly avoided a whole class of scaling problem – data gets too big – move the whole account to a better server.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ever notice that while there are security holes in WordPress itself, they never seem to be a big deal for WordPress.com?  Well this is why.  Breaches are contained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d argue that this single design decision dramatically affected WordPress’s success.  People don’t often thing about software architecture decisions making the difference between commercial success and failure but I was there and I’m pretty damn certain of this.  Now Matt would have been fine no matter what but this one decision, I’ve always thought, helped ensure the success of the overall WordPress enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Matt certainly isn’t the only one who has done this.  Down the road I’d see the same issue at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Fitzpatrick&quot;&gt;Brad Fitzpatrick’s&lt;/a&gt; LiveJournal.  And it wouldn’t surprise me if Brad actually did it first since Brad usually has done everything first.  I’d also consult on a similar architecture when I worked at StreamSend where I saw the harder side of managing such an architecture – rolling deploys and database migrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Please note that I have no idea if WordPress.com still uses this same structure today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Tools for Elixir Development</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the first things you do as a developer when tackling a new platform is suss out tools.  Here’s what I’ve found so far for Elixir:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-elixir&quot;&gt;Autocomplete for Elixir&lt;/a&gt;  I’m still sticking to my beloved TextMate for Elixir development but this is tempting.  Better autocomplete may be the killer app for Elixir development.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://kapeli.com/dash&quot;&gt;Dash for Documentation&lt;/a&gt; (obligatory shout out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scrogson/&quot;&gt;Sonny Scrogson&lt;/a&gt; for teaching a great course and showing me Dash)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.getpostman.com&quot;&gt;Postman&lt;/a&gt; (for testing JSON apis you build with Elixir)  Courtesy of &lt;a href=&quot;http://dasari.me&quot;&gt;Dv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.erlang-solutions.com/products/wombat-oam.html&quot;&gt;Wombat&lt;/a&gt; for Elixir / Erlang Monitoring&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.honeybadger.io/for/elixir/&quot;&gt;HoneyBadger&lt;/a&gt; for managing Elixir errors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other great Elixir resources include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.phoenixframework.org&quot;&gt;Phoenix Framework&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pragprog.com/book/phoenix/programming-phoenix&quot;&gt;The Phoenix Book&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pragprog.com/book/elixir13/programming-elixir-1-3&quot;&gt;The Elixir Book&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;datetime support is still a mess; the erlang libs are just as bad; Just rely on a unix timestamp on the box and manipulate it yourself (Pete)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;deal with deployment at the container level; don’t do native deployment (Ben)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;whenever possible pick a stable Erlang library over an immature hex project (Ian)  &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gamache?tab=repositories&quot;&gt;Pete’s libraries&lt;/a&gt; are an exception; he’s using them in production.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;tests run so fast (and concurrently) that you’ve lost your “Go get a coffee” excuse while the test runs break.  Damn.  (Ian)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I misquoted anyone I apologize; errors are mine not theirs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;official-things---phoenix-13-changes&quot;&gt;Official Things - Phoenix 1.3 Changes:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Directory structure changes:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;/web&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;/model&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;/lib/my_app/&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MyApp.Web.PageController &amp;lt;== new web namespace&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Generators are changing greatly  - creating a module and functions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Umbrella generator for microservices within a phoenix “umbrella”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;things-i-came-up-with&quot;&gt;Things I came up with:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One thing that concerns me is the ability to parachute into an Elixir project and work on it.  Say what you want about Rails but its standard nature has made it very easy for a consultant to drop in on a project and fix it.  I’m less sure about that with Elixir.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you don’t fully understand the syntax yet (and you won’t if you’re like most of us) then you can ctrl+c ctrl+c in and out of console to test that your code is right (&lt;strong&gt;iex -S mix)&lt;/strong&gt;.  Since Elixir is compiled, just bringing up the repl means it works&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Elixir is all over the place.  I’ve met more people from, well, &lt;strong&gt;insert generic middle of the country location&lt;/strong&gt; than I have from San Francisco.  That’s damn odd for a cutting edge technology.  I don’t know what it says about San Francisco.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because the elixir language is implemented as macros instead of as language constructs, there are some syntactical oddities that mess you up.  Here’s an example:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;%= if @current_user do %&amp;gt;
    # do something
  &amp;lt;% else %&amp;gt;
    # do something ese
  &amp;lt;% end %&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coming from a rails perspective you’d expect that to be &amp;lt;% if %&amp;gt;    not &amp;lt;%= %&amp;gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Immutable, Immutable, Immutable (just to remind myself)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pattern matching over conditionals.  Ok this one was from Sonny as part of the Phoenix class.  Yesterday in that class we build a login system with only 1 if / else block.  Astonishing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The lack of a prebuilt login system is astonishing.  Yes we built one ourselves and did it pretty easily but that’s not the same as “we should have done it”.  There are so many edge cases in authentication that I tend to shy away from it.  Wolfram Arnold taught me this on my very first Rails gig and it remains as good advice now as it was then.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The generators in Phoenix are astonishingly good.  Wow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll update this as the conference runs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Turn Off Rails 5 Default Foreign Key Migrations</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I could swear that I’ve written this down before but I can’t find it now and, as usual, I blog as much for myself as I do for anyone else.  When Rails 5 came out it made foreign key migrations standard and that, as any major change, bites lots of existing users.  It certainly has me.  Here’s how to turn it off:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn off your server.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create an initializer in config/initializers named active_record_belongs_to_required_by_default.rb  You could also name it “you_suck_rails.rb” (yeah I’m at ElixirCon so hitting this, today, is beyond bitter).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add this content:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;#Be sure to restart your server when you modify this file.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;#Require &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;belongs_to&lt;/code&gt; associations by default. This is a new Rails 5.0&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;#default, so it is introduced as a configuration option to ensure that apps&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;#made on earlier versions of Rails are not affected when upgrading.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Rails.application.config.active_record.belongs_to_required_by_default = false
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
