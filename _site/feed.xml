        <title>What Just Happened To Your Database In the Past 10 Minutes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So I’m rapidly coming to the conclusion that Christmas is the enemy of getting things done.  While I have come up with a lot of potential topics to write about recently I don’t seem to be able to get anything actually finished due to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Present Shopping&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Present Wrapping&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Christmas Events (parties, choir concerts, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Christmas Baking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alas – at least, as my old boss, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rafer&quot;&gt;Scott Rafer&lt;/a&gt;, used to say – &lt;em&gt;these are high quality problems to have&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick post today – looking at the state of your database.  Let’s say you have a table called posts and it has a field called created_at (the Rails standard way of tracking table changes) and you want to see how many things came into that table in the past 10 minutes.  Here’s the sql you need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT COUNT(*) FROM posts WHERE created_at &amp;gt; DATE_ADD(NOW(),INTERVAL - 10 MINUTE);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously I’ve generally looked at tables and then tried to relate what’s going on to the current time and adjust in my head for the server time zone offset.  This is &lt;strong&gt;much, much&lt;/strong&gt; better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A really nice side effect of this is that you can simply change the interval quickly and see if your performance is linear or non-linear.  Let’s say you change your interval to 5, 10 and 15 minutes and this was the result:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Considering Phabricator</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So I ran across &lt;a href=&quot;https://phacility.com/phabricator/&quot;&gt;phabricator&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://phacility.com&quot;&gt;phacility&lt;/a&gt; recently and I’m intrigued.  I also had a horrific out of the box experience trying it out that I thought nicely illustrated a number of what I consider straight up fails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phabricator is a multi author code review and management tool that was originally built at Facebook and is now a hosted open source product.  They describe it as: &lt;em&gt;Discuss. Plan. Code. Review. Test. - Every application your project needs, all in one tool.&lt;/em&gt; and I think that’s a fairly solid overview.  They also have a hell of a great sense of humor and if you haven’t read this &lt;a href=&quot;https://phacility.com/phabricator/&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; then you should go there now and search for either intern or purple.  +10 for the sense of humor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I went to phacility and chose to set up a hosted instance in order to evaluate it.  Here’s my sad, short, less than sweet experience:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Apple MacBook Pro Alternatives</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Well I’m certainly not the only one who is curious about life beyond the Macbook:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/broken-window/my-search-for-a-macbook-pro-alternative-e549ea2b2dee#.j80auzeup&quot;&gt;Medium Article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly he didn’t even mention &lt;a href=&quot;https://system76.com/&quot;&gt;System 76&lt;/a&gt; which makes native Ubuntu laptops.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>AWS Tutorial - Using Squid, EC2 and ELB to Defeat Crawling Blockages</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I write crawlers.  I have crawlers for years.  And I &lt;strong&gt;hate&lt;/strong&gt; beyond &lt;strong&gt;hate&lt;/strong&gt; when companies throw up roadblocks to defeat crawlers.  As a general rule of thumb the big Internet companies tend to be the worst at this – they, who shall be unnamed, love information to be “free” but they hate like hell to themselves be indexed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, in the age of the cloud, crawling blockages can be really, really easy to defeat.  In this tutorial I’m going to show you how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;proxying&quot;&gt;Proxying&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core technology to defeat blockages is simple – you use a proxy server.  Let’s say that you have a server on this ip address:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;24.36.48.19
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone wants to block your crawler all they need to do is place a block on that ip address by any number of means - code, router level, firewall level, etc and your code can’t actually access the data.  A proxy server sits in between your code and the data you want to access.  Here’s a ruby example using Mechanize:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;agent = Mechanize.new
url = &quot;http://www.google.com/&quot;
proxy_server_url = &quot;proxy.foo.com&quot;
proxy_server_port = 3199    
agent.set_proxy(proxy_server_url, proxy_server_port)
page = agent.get(url)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That will cause the request to be through the proxy server and NOT from your actual server.  Given that a proxy server can be blocked as easily as your actual server this may not seem all that significant – but think of this in terms of a cloud computing environment like AWS:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In aws you can create instances trivially with tools like ansible&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In aws you can automatically / automagically install a full featured proxy server like squid with one command&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In aws you can front end a cluster of proxy server instances behind an elastic load balancer allowing your software to simply access the load balancer and then the proxy servers can be dynamically replaced either when they are blocked or perhaps proactively every single day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;squid&quot;&gt;Squid&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Squid is the proxy server we’re going to be using.  Squid is an old school Internet tool – I remember experimenting with it back in maybe 2002 although that seems impossible but it actually isn’t since it is cited in papers going back to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_(software)&quot;&gt;1995&lt;/a&gt;.  We’re going to need to use the 3.5 or later version of Squid since we need support for what is called ProxyPass which is what lets a proxy transaction travel through a load balancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re uncertain about the installed version of Squid then run this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;/usr/sbin/squid -v
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://mamchenkov.net/wordpress/2004/03/23/how-to-check-squid-proxy-server-version-on-a-linux-system/&quot;&gt;Mamchenkov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Troubleshooting an ELB in Front of an EC2 Running Squid&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create the proxy programmatically using proxy protocoal&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Squid has to be 3.5 or later&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure that the ec2 has the proxy port open in its security group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ec2 has a sec group
lb has a security group&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;make sure the ports are sync’d&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;architecture&quot;&gt;Architecture&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to need the following architecture bits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;an elastic load balancer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 or more EC2 instances that run squid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;ansibling-this-all-together&quot;&gt;Ansibling This All Together&lt;/h1&gt;

        <title>Rails Commando - Parachuting into a Rails Code Base and Adding Value from Day 1</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2009, 2 weeks before Christmas, with no notice, I and the rest of the eduFire startup were laid off with no notice, no severance and no benefits save, I believe, some small level of legally required COBRA.  My role was VP of Engineering and I held stock options on 10% of the company.  It was a mind-blowing level of &lt;strong&gt;suck&lt;/strong&gt; and one that I doubt I’ll ever forgive the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonbischke&quot;&gt;founder&lt;/a&gt; for – classless in every single way.  I think it was also the last time I’ve trusted an organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I’m a firm believer that there are good times and there are bad and while 2009 was the heights of suck, it launched me down the path of “make lots and lots of money from consulting” and that’s been fantastic for me.  In particular I’ve become more than a bit of what I refer to as a &lt;em&gt;rails commando&lt;/em&gt; – I can drop into a Rails code base and add value from Day 1.  This blog post talks about how I go about that.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Incredible Smartness of Bezos or A New Revenue Stream for Amazon with Amazon Go</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Before I made a full commitment this past summer to AWS, I read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Everything-Store-Jeff-Bezos-Amazon/dp/0316219282/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1481104973&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=The+Everything+Store&quot;&gt;The Everything Store&lt;/a&gt; which is a detailed analysis of how Amazon operates and Jeff Bezos personally.  As someone who has been an entrepreneur on many different occasions, I find this type of book particularly compelling and this particular book was no exception.  What I walked away from the book were these observations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jeff Bezos is at the essential core of Amazon’s success; yes there are many other talented executives but at its heart it is Jeff’s place.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jeff Bezos is a once in a century type businessman and if I don’t think of in the same light as Gates, Rockefeller and Carnegie then I’m making a massive mistake.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is far, far smarter for me to commit to AWS than it is for me to fight AWS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that, dear reader, is why I went full scale with AWS.  Yes there were &lt;a href=&quot;https://fuzzygroup.github.io/blog/aws.html&quot;&gt;technical reasons&lt;/a&gt; as well but at its heart it was a bet on Bezos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-this-categorized-as-startup&quot;&gt;What is this Categorized as Startup&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that Amazon is literally a globe spanning entity with aggregate revenues north of 100 billion, you may find it odd that my primary category for this piece is startup.  Well Amazon, at least to me, just plain acts like a startup.  The level of innovation that the company consistently delivers is breath taking.  I mean what other big company launches new things at the pace that Amazon does?  Honestly Amazon is a startup at least in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;amazon-go&quot;&gt;Amazon Go&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now I come to yesterday’s announcement of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/b?node=16008589011#&quot;&gt;Amazon Go&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13105689&quot;&gt;Hacker News Discussion&lt;/a&gt;, a complete re-thinking of grocery stores.  Amazon has announced that they will be building 2,000 local grocery stores which are basically a complete rethinking of the grocery store concept implemented along the lines of a convenience store.  Particularly interesting to me since I grew up working retail were these ideas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;no cashier&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;wave your phone when you enter to authenticate yourself&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;shop by putting items in your basket; take whatever you want&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;amazon figures out what you bought and automatically charges your credit card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think about all the various services that Amazon offers through AWS this is a clear implementation of those services applied to the physical world.  In specific I’d place a good bet that this will be powered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2016/09/introducing-amazon-ec2-p2-instances-the-largest-gpu-powered-virtual-machine-in-the-cloud/&quot;&gt;GPU instances&lt;/a&gt; using some kind of machine vision API that you’ll see announced next year at the next Amazon developer conference. And I’d be surprised if we don’t see the store proactively reaching out to people’s phones using the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/lex/&quot;&gt;Amazon Lex&lt;/a&gt; ChatBot tool to say something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I see that you picked up and put down three different types of red meat.  In case it helps make your buying decision we have a 10% instant coupon on any type of red meat you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this would be dynamically coupled with an &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/&quot;&gt;Amazon Redshift&lt;/a&gt; warehouse analysis of inventory trends and if meat is going to spoil or not.  Amazon could entirely automate what a talented meat department manager does for a grocery store only better because the special is dynamically delivered to customers who are much more likely to buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-new-revenue-stream-for-amazon&quot;&gt;A New Revenue Stream for Amazon&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new revenue stream that I see coming out of this is consumer marketing data.  My strong guess is that Amazon will be able to roll up data from actions like pick up and put down on an individual consumer level and then see that type of analytics back to consumer goods firms.  Now I’m sure that Amazon already licenses some consumer marketing data to companies but I suspect this is going to be fairly unprecedented.  Let’s say that you are a consumer goods company that just rolled out a new label.  Here’s what I can envision happening:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New label rolls out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Amazon is able to give you time adjusted comparisons of shopping experiences before and after along with being able to watch the consumers interact with the product.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Think of this as a/b analytics for the real world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I doubt there’s a single person reading this who, whether or not they believe in a/b testing, doesn’t understand the power it offers.  Personally I’m not a fan but as a marketer I can see this being truly compelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;my-wifes-reaction&quot;&gt;My Wife’s Reaction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife isn’t part of the high tech world anymore but she had an interesting reaction:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;All restaurants are going to be Taco Bell!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Props to her for an outstanding nerd culture reference, the 1993 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106697/?ref_=nv_sr_1&quot;&gt;Demolition Man&lt;/a&gt; movie starring Stallone, Bullock and Snipes of a dystopian future where literally all restaurants are Taco Bell.  Perhaps all commerce will be Amazon…&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>No Rdoc Once and For All</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After watching me swear like a sailor earlier today, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dasari.me/&quot;&gt;Dv&lt;/a&gt; provided this snippet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cat ~/.gemrc
install: --no-rdoc --no-ri
update: --no-rdoc --no-ri
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never again will I have to wait for rdoc to generate (which at times takes longer than the damn gem itself).  Huzzah!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Code Rot is Very, Very Real</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today has been an unmitigated disaster.  In the process of reviving a &lt;a href=&quot;https://fuzzygroup.github.io/blog/osx/2016/12/06/bringing-an-old-macbook-pro-back-to-life.html&quot;&gt;MacBook Pro that was old&lt;/a&gt; I had to delete and re-install rvm, gemsets, etc and, &lt;strong&gt;damn&lt;/strong&gt;, has it ever sucked.  And I don’t mean “oh it sucked” – I mean this has sucked monkey balls.  I’ve been at it 12 hours and my conclusion is that I’m not sure that it will ever work.  And this brings us to &lt;strong&gt;code rot&lt;/strong&gt;.  Rot is what happens to a physical artifact when you don’t take care of it.  Now if you haven’t been at this for too long you’re thinking something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These are perfect digital assets how can there possibly be rot; Scott is smoking the whacky weed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alas, no and I wish I was.  Even if your digital assets don’t decay, the supporting ecosystem that they are in actually does change.  As an example part of the Gemfile had a nokogiri 1.4.4 hard coded version number in it.  Now I might refer to Nokogiri as NokoVietnameGiri since I’m generally about as successful in installing Nokogiri as the U.S. was in winning Vietnam.  But today was far, far worse.  Finally I discovered that Nokogiri 1.4.x is now considered too old and things have changed too much and their recommendation is simple – &lt;strong&gt;upgrade&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: No disrespect meant to anyone or their family involved in Vietnam.  Vietnam was a political war and soldiers were not allowed to win it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s what I mean by code rot – all executable code these days depends on a precarious web of dependencies.  If you’re not actively maintaining it then you are very, very much hosed should a sufficient amount of time pass and you need to re-install things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case I have to go into a code base that has laid fallow for well over a year now.  And while it has run like a champ until recently, certain things have changed and I now need to actively make changes to the code, modify vendored gems, etc.  And that means I really, really need a workable code base.  And without the ability to run bundle install, well, I’ve got nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I grew up in a family that made their living from, among other things, real estate, I’m going to make an analogy.  If you owned physical real estate, you wouldn’t dream of not touching it for more than a year – you’d expect to do small maintenance, plumbing,  paint, weatherstrip, whatever.  And if it was a revenue producing property, as this was a revenue producing bit of software, you would really never dream of letting it lie fallow for a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So code rot is real but I don’t think that it really is any different from physical artifacts.  The universe does, after all, trend from order to disorder, towards ever increasing entropy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line here is that the next time someone tells you that its ok to let code just sit around and decay, perhaps you might advocate more strongly for doing at least some maintenance on it.  I strongly wish that I had done a better job of that.  &lt;em&gt;regrets&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bringing an Old MacBook Pro Back to Life</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This morning has been more than a tad frustrating – and let’s leave Tad out of this, shall we?  I’ve been engaged in bringing my 2011 MacBook Pro 15 back to life.  After a brief venture into Linux, I found that I really needed the data on this box back and despite my Time Machine woes I was able to restore most everything.  I’m now trying to make it actually a functional development tool since it is the only machine that generally seems to run this particular obsolete gem stack – although &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dasari.me/&quot;&gt;Dv&lt;/a&gt; would argue I should just kill everything and run Vagrant – something I’m thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the process I’ve been thru:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;kill brew and reinstall it: &lt;strong&gt;ruby -e “$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/uninstall)”&lt;/strong&gt; and then &lt;strong&gt;ruby -e “$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;kill rvm and re-install it: &lt;strong&gt;rvm implode&lt;/strong&gt; and then **\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;bash** &lt;a href=&quot;https://richonrails.com/articles/uninstalling-rvm&quot;&gt;Docs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/tbody&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;install cask room: &lt;strong&gt;brew cask install google-chrome&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://caskroom.github.io/&quot;&gt;Docs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;kill bundler and re-install it:  &lt;strong&gt;gem install bundler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;kill gem and reinstall it: &lt;strong&gt;gem update –system ‘2.3.0’&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13626143/how-to-upgrade-rubygems&quot;&gt;SO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then updated my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fuzzygroup/ansible-macbook-pro&quot;&gt;Ansible MacBook Pro configuration routine&lt;/a&gt; and ran it against the box.  And then I hit a high degree of &lt;a href=&quot;https://fuzzygroup.github.io/blog/rails/2016/12/06/code-rot-is-very-very-real.html&quot;&gt;code rot&lt;/a&gt; that, well, totally ruined my day.&lt;/p&gt;
