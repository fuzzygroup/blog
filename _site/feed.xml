        <title>Linux Tip of the Day inotifywait</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My podcast listening, which has always been on the nerdy side, has recently taken a trip down the far, far nerdier rabbit hole.  Whereas I used to listen to things with at least some connection to pop culture such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://majorspoilers.com/category/podcast/&quot;&gt;Major Spoilers&lt;/a&gt;, I now find myself listening to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ubuntupodcast.org/&quot;&gt;Ubuntu Podcast&lt;/a&gt;, a British podcast covering the Ubuntu community.  It was there that I learned about inotifywait and I had a feeling it was brilliant.  I tried it out and it is brilliant!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To install on Linux, use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;sudo apt-get install inotify-tools&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since inotify is a Linux api this doesn’t exist for OSX but you can use an open source tool called notifywait available &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ggreer/fsevents-tools&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Alternatively there is fswatch which can be easily installed with &lt;strong&gt;brew fswatch&lt;/strong&gt;.  Please note that I didn’t try either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inotifywait utility takes a few command line parameters and then tells you all file accesses that go on in that directory.  This sounds a bit obscure but here’s how I tested it last night:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;inotifywait ~ -mr&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tells inotifywait to run on the ~ or home directory and monitor it forever (the m flag) and r tells it to monitor recursively on all directories below the current.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of its output once I set it monitoring in one shell window on a server after I logged into the same box in a different shell window and then touched the file foo.txt:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/inotifywait.png&quot; alt=&quot;inotifywait.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The really interesting here is intellectually I know that the bash prompt initialization pattern is .profile =&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only is this useful for sysadmin / devops work but I can see it being highly useful for application developers. Sometimes the files you are touching or your io access patterns are not always apparent.  Using inotifywait makes them obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different events can even be monitored with the –e flag.  Here’s what you can monitor for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Events:
	access		file or directory contents were read
	modify		file or directory contents were written
	attrib		file or directory attributes changed
	close_write	file or directory closed, after being opened in
	           	writable mode
	close_nowrite	file or directory closed, after being opened in
	           	read-only mode
	close		file or directory closed, regardless of read/write mode
	open		file or directory opened
	moved_to	file or directory moved to watched directory
	moved_from	file or directory moved from watched directory
	move		file or directory moved to or from watched directory
	create		file or directory created within watched directory
	delete		file or directory deleted within watched directory
	delete_self	file or directory was deleted
	unmount		file system containing file or directory unmounted
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Linux Tip of the Day - git recall</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Every so often your boss asks you what you’ve been working on and if you have been all over a code base it can actually be hard to break it down.  The new git recall command actually makes this pretty easy.  This is a new Linux tool I just learned about - &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Fakerr/git-recall&quot;&gt;Docs&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13517486&quot;&gt;Hacker News Discussion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install it on Linux as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;npm install –global git-recall&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install it on OSX as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;brew install less&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-or- you might need to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;brew install homebrew/dupes/less&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: I know you already have less installed on your system.  You need lesskey which git recall relies on but Apple, unhelpfully, &lt;a href=&quot;http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/27269/is-less1-missing-lesskey-functionality&quot;&gt;did not include&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have lesskey then you need to install git recall itself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;npm install –global git-recall&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you change into a directory where you’re working on something git, do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;git recall&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial view shows you your commits in a recent time frame:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/git_recall1.png&quot; alt=&quot;git_recall_.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can go up and down the list and select a commit that you’re interested in with the arrow keys and enter or j/k and enter.  I had issues with the arrow keys so keep j/k in mind.  Then you’ll see the commit details:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>20 Days of Zero</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Note: This really is about weight loss and I’ll even show much much I lost but I’m looking at this from a startup context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I generally find people’s second act in the startup world far, far more interesting than people’s first act.  By second act, of course, I am referring to when an entrepreneur tries to replicate the lightning in a bottle experience that they initially had when they built a startup.  Second acts seem to almost always be less successful than people’s first act.  Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Hawkins&quot;&gt;Jeff Hawkins&lt;/a&gt; who built Palm and then Handspring into a multi billion success is now working on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numenta&quot;&gt;Numenta&lt;/a&gt; software that mimic human memory – and he’s been at it for more than a decade&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Charles Ferguson who built Vermeer, the original creators of FrontPage, left high tech entirely and is now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Ferguson_(filmmaker)&quot;&gt;film maker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen&quot;&gt;Marc Andreessen&lt;/a&gt; who created Netscape then created Opsware and is now a Venture capitalist&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rose&quot;&gt;Kevin Rose&lt;/a&gt; founded Digg which although it is much forgotten these days was once upon a time beating Reddit in the social space.  He then did Pownce and is now doing an app called Zero for weight loss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that, dear reader, brings us to Kevin Rose and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@kevinrose/introducing-zero-a-new-app-to-help-you-fast-209935e8245d&quot;&gt;Zero&lt;/a&gt;.  Zero is a new app for what is termed Intermittent Fasting (IF) which is a technique where you fast for a long stretch of the day on an ongoing basis.  Here’s what the app looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/873/1*C9hnNf_51CYUoTl_MFBeYA.png&quot; alt=&quot;Zero App&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve now been using Zero since 1/7 so I have 20 days on it which I think is enough to make some comments.  On 1/7 I weighed in at 194 which isn’t an all time high for me but does reflect, well, post Christmas and Holiday weight gain.  I certainly wasn’t fat by any means but I felt larger than I wanted to be.  After showing my wife Zero we made the joint decision to go on Zero.  My wife suffers from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease&quot;&gt;Celiac disease&lt;/a&gt; in a fairly bad way and by the after Christmas period she was in pretty much constant stomach pain.  Zero, at the time, seemed like a fairly rational decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s my weight metrics, unsophisticated as they are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/weight_metrics.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;weight_metrics.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: This was originally written late last week which is why the day count is slightly different.  I’ve lost about another pound since this was written but it wasn’t worth updating the picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I started Zero I have lost almost 10 pounds which for a 49 year old man is, I think, fairly good.  The only real goal I had at the start of this was a Gandalf like approach to buying new jeans.  When I found out, post Christmas, that my jeans didn’t fit all that well, I took the position:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Thou Shalt Not Buy Bigger Pants! (Gandalf to a group of fat hobbits)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am happy to report that no new jeans have been purchased and their fit is much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;adding-whole-30-to-zero&quot;&gt;Adding Whole 30 to Zero&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot say that all of this is tied to Zero.  On 1/15 one of my wife’s good friends, H, convinced her to go on &lt;a href=&quot;http://whole30.com/&quot;&gt;Whole 30&lt;/a&gt; and I came along for the chaos.  Whole30 is one of those diets where you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;drink no alcohol&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;no sugar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;no preservatives&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;no dairy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;no corn&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;no carbs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;eat only things you cook yourself&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;eat only meats and vegetables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that I cook everything from scratch already this basically amounted to slight modifications to what I already cook.  I’ve never drank so the alcohol restrictions amounted to “don’t put wine in the beef stew made yesterday” and didn’t affect me at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while I can’t say that all of this is due to Zero, I think the bulk of the weight loss is attributable to the Zero’s Intermittent Fasting approach.  By reducing the window of time during which you can eat down to say 7 to 8 hours, my wife and I have gone from two large meals (lunch and dinner) generally down to 1 (lunch) and a snack (dinner).  So from a weight loss perspective, I suspect the reduction in overall food volume is a bigger contributor than the foods I’ve taken out of my diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I’ve been fairly pleased with Whole 30 as a approach to food.  My wife’s constant stomach pains are gone so that’s a huge win from my perspective.  That was why I agreed to go on it and it has been a complete success in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the Whole 30  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0544854411?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=whole3009c-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0544854411&quot;&gt;cookbook&lt;/a&gt; isn’t all that good.  The recipes fall into that difficult, pretentious category of recipe where my comment would generally be “trying too hard”.  Additionally some of the recipes are flat out either bad or wrong (don’t try to make mayonaise their way; go get &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Food-Lab-Cooking-Through-Science/dp/0393081087/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1485516745&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=kenji+lopez+alt&quot;&gt;Kenji’s book&lt;/a&gt;) or follow &lt;a href=&quot;http://thepioneerwoman.com/food-and-friends/how-to-make-mayonnaise/&quot;&gt;the Pioneer Woman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;comments-on-the-zero-app&quot;&gt;Comments on the Zero App&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Zero app is very much no nonsense – you get a calendar and a few different options for scheduling your fasts and that’s it.  And that’s my biggest problem with it – there’s no way to add your own data to the fast.  I would have very much liked it if say you could attach a picture of each meal you ate to each day.  Or if you could put in a weight metric.  Or if you could put in how you felt.  I’d love to know how many days of Zero it took for my wife to feel better but I have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still Zero led to me losing 10 pounds and that’s nothing to disregard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do get some summary metrics – I can see my average fast time was 16h 49m and that on average I ate for only 6 minutes during the night (I was using the Circadian approach to fasting).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;getting-zero&quot;&gt;Getting Zero&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zero can be gotten from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zero-fasting-tracker/id1168348542?mt=8&quot;&gt;App Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;getting-whole30&quot;&gt;Getting Whole30&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My recommendation would be to just get the baseline &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Whole30-30-Day-Guide-Health-Freedom/dp/0544609719&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; and then ignore their whole philosophy and just focus on the food aspect of it.  Diets, these days, generally seem to be as much guru advice as they are diet and, honestly, I doubt you need a guru.  I know I don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;overall&quot;&gt;Overall&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zero is ridiculously simple to use does make it easy to stick with a fast.  Pairing Zero with Whole30 did seem to produce, at least for me, overall weight loss and, I think, some health gains.  Recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Linux Tip of the Day - Use ncdu for Disc Space Usage</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If I was to look back over the time I’ve spent doing sys admin work, I would guess that I’ve spent more time singing the song:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Where oh here has my disc space gone, Where oh where could it be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;than anything else.  Managing storage just plain &lt;strong&gt;sucks&lt;/strong&gt;.  And ever since we moved from hard discs to first SSDs and now cloud boxes with 8 gig partitions, well, its a bigger issue than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Linux and OSX tool ncdu actually makes this pretty easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install on Linux it as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;sudo apt-get install ncdu&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install on OSX it as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;brew install ncdu&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start it as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;ncdu&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you will get a character mode interface you can move with the arrow keys to get a better feel for the disc space.  Here are some screen shots:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/ncdu1.png&quot; alt=&quot;ncdu1.png&quot; /&gt;

        <title>Linux Tip of the Day - Use bmon for Bandwidth Monitoring</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently was trying to upload several terabytes of data over to AWS’ S3 file storage.  Given that inbound transfers to S3 are actually free, this wasn’t as pricey as it might seem.  The transfer seemed slow so &lt;a href=&quot;http://nickjanetakis.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/a&gt; suggested using Bandwidth Monitoring software, an obvious thing, but something I didn’t even know existed.  The tool Nick recommended was bmon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install it as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;sudo apt-get install bmon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start it as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;bmon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you can see:&lt;/p&gt;
