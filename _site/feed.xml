        <title>Starting Learnings - What Kevin Burton Taught Me</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I got to know &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/burtonator&quot;&gt;Kevin Burton&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spinn3r.com/&quot;&gt;Spinn3r&lt;/a&gt; fame back in my Feedster days and while I don’t know him tremendously well, I absolutely learned from him.  Interestingly, unlike a lot of my Silicon Valley contacts where I learned from them at the time, the learnings from Kevin came later, much later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The classic valley business model is what I’d describe as “up or out” i.e. you either get big fast become wildly successful or your flame out.  Either way you either go up or you go out.  But what if you are actually passionate about what you do?  What if you don’t want to go out or even to get tremendously big?  What if you want to do the kind of work you love and that you are great at?  Well, while in Silicon Valley, this would generally be viewed with derision as a “lifestyle business”, there isn’t anything wrong with it.  Hell, running a business successfully for years at a time, is a hell of an accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin is a search engine guy and he’s smart.  He’s at the level of understanding that can be described as “Let’s write the search engine from scratch”.  That’s smart.  And when I first got to know him back in 2005 / 2006, he was just getting started with Spinn3r and he’s still at it.  He’s building a great product that solves a real problem.  And he’s even become a part of academia in being cited in over &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=spinn3r&quot;&gt;350 papers&lt;/a&gt; that are studying the rise of the social web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here’s what I learned from Kevin Burton:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Persistence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do what you love.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all love the myth of the overnight success but real life isn’t like that.  Succeeding at anything takes copious amounts of time and persistence.  Doing what you love makes persistence easier and Kevin has taught that to me in spades.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>iPad for Productivity Take Two</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fuzzygroup.github.io/blog/ipad/2016/09/13/is-an-ipad-a-serious-productivity-tool.html&quot;&gt;Yesterday&lt;/a&gt; I posited that an iPad could be a serious productivity tool and I later realized “well that’s interesting and all but have you really ever created anything on one?”  So to quell my inner self doubt, I set out to try and even though I had my laptop right next to me, I opted to use my iPad and, in about an hour, I had produced 1091 words of &lt;a href=&quot;https://fuzzygroup.github.io/blog/parenting/2016/09/14/childhood-memories.html&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.  No real need to read it – it is a personal piece on parenting and childhood.  Not my average bit of word flow but something that just raced off my finger tips in an inspiring flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Given that I was sitting in the dark next to a sick child as I wrote this, the fact that I could do it so quickly even using a less than perfect keyboard says something.  And while I say less than perfect, that doesn’t mean its bad.  The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Belkin-QODE-Ultimate-Keyboard-Black/dp/B00Q5CZ0LQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=pc&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1473849549&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=belkin+qode&quot;&gt;Belkin keyboard&lt;/a&gt; I’m using is as good as I’ve found and I really do love it.  The editor I used was &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/notesy-for-dropbox/id386095500?mt=8&quot;&gt;Notesy for Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; and its seamless sync meant that I could write on the iPad and then do a cat ~/me/notesy/childhood_memories.txt&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;pbcopy to let me paste it into TextMate on my mac for final editing before using Jekyll to publish it.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notesy is actually quite good.  It is vastly better than editors I used to live in like ScripSit on a TRS-80 Model I where everything I wrote from high school thru my first two years of college was published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I put my money where my mouth is and I actually did create content using nothing but an iPad.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Childhood Memories</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am writing this at 4 am sitting by my youngest’s bedside,  Yesterday was a fabulous day from the parents perspective and from his I suspect had a &lt;em&gt;high degree of suck&lt;/em&gt;.  We are at DisneyWorld right now and my wife arranged for us to take an end of day safari.  This is a new offering from DisneyWorld’s Animal Kingdom and it was a limited person safari (just 10 people) that finished with a private meal on a viewing platform in the middle of Animal Kingdom’s Serengeti area.  We had a fantastic guide, Jason, who was not only knowledgeable but just plain beyond entertaining.  My boys liked him so well that they even wanted his picture with him at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the animals we saw&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;birds, birds, birds and more birds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;giraffes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;wildebeests&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;elephants&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;zebras&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;springboks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a rhino&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;hyenas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rabbits (ok Florida native but still, bunnies!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lions sitting proudly out in the rain - clearly not water phobic house cats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s just what I can blearily remember as I’m sitting up with him.  On the way back there was even a torrential rainstorm and it made off us feel like we were in deepest Africa.  My oldest kept making media references like 
“Jurassic Park” and others.  And, according to our guide, rain brings out the critters and it sure did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why, you ask, if the boys liked it so well would my youngest describe it as  “a high degree of suck”. Well the poor little guy didn’t take too well to the food.  The meal was all African inspired and by the walk out of the park he was looking queasy.  And, horrifyingly, on the cab home he had reached full on exorcist level of spewage – yes I caught it all in my hands using a Disney poncho as a mock bucket.  He then spent the rest of the night vomiting repeatedly.  I think the issue was the food because the last time we had African food at Disney, &lt;a href=&quot;https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/dining/animal-kingdom-lodge/boma-flavors-of-africa/&quot;&gt;Booma&lt;/a&gt;, I didn’t even make it out of the parking lot before I lost my entire meal in much the same fashion.  I think he clearly got my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now since my youngest has been raised in an environment of media on demand (thanks &lt;a href=&quot;http://plex.tv&quot;&gt;Plex&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.roku.com&quot;&gt;Roku&lt;/a&gt;), video games (thanks iPad) and similar distractions there were times when he was bored - “No you can’t play Pokemon Go when we’re on Safari!”.  And then there was the whole exorcist level of spewage so that is why I think he would, today, describe it as a “high level of suck”. But I’m going to put on my parental “look into the future goggles” and predict that in 15 or 20 years this will be one of his fondest childhood memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would I make such a claim given the tale above?  Well it just so happens that I have a similar childhood memory - actually a set of childhood memories - around when my father and I used to go duck hunting.  Starting when I was in fifth grade, my Dad and I used to take off for a week and go down to the eastern shore of Maryland to stay in a cabin on an island, Fishhook Island and go duck hunting.  We had a professional guide, John Holgrapher, and, at the time, these were miserable experiences for a 10 year old boy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I remember being so cold that I would crawl in the very nose of the boat under what little decking there was and breathe on my hands to keep them from freezing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I wasn’t old enough to use a gun for the first two years so there was, well, just waiting around; no toys, electronics, books or anything; just waiting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that would be my equivalent child hood memory to M’s Safari. And, yeah it was miserable, as I look back on it.  But those few, precious trips with my father, are some of favorite memories of growing up with him.  I’ve told the tales to my wife and kids over and over again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sitting at the long breakfast table in the cabin doing my homework and listening to AM radio – that’s where I was when I learned that Mark David Chapman had killed John Lennon&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Being trapped out by low tide shifts on a full moon from 3 pm past 4 am and having to cook our dinner - a duck we had shot hours earlier - on a campfire that I started&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seeing an enormous flight of 30 plus black duck settle into our decoys and our not getting even one of them (buck fever); my Dad who grew up hunting with his Dad hadn’t seen such a large flight of black duck in over 25 years&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hunting with my grand uncle and his best friend&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rising before the sun - 3 am - to be out in the duck blind before the birds could see us&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Getting into a tiny aluminum skiff and setting out for the blind in total darkness and yet the guide always getting us precisely there on the first try; to this day I don’t know how&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hearing our guide ask us “You like oysters?” and then reach over the side of the boat and pull up, with his bare hands, what seemed like a half bushel which he fed us on the spot.  He then, I kid you not, reached into his chest high waders and pulled out a bottle of cocktail sauce.  First oyster I ever ate,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Being connected to the mainland only by a CB radio so we were really, truly alone for a week at a time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No bathing facilities at all - we used to get home from a week’s hunting and stinking to high heaven&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could go on.  I have like 20 of my most precious memories and they are all rooted in those trips.  I suspect that fifteen or twenty years from now, M will tell the tale of the Disney Safari and how his parents took him to see tigers, giraffes and elephants oh my!  And how we headed back thru a rain storm so fierce that it came thru the roof the jeep we were in.  I hope he leaves out the spew just as I never mention the cold and the waiting.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Is an iPad a Serious Productivity Tool?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I just had a friend email me something including this text:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will be interesting to see how the iPad unfolds.  I find it hard to believe it’ll be a serious productivity tool until voice rec or a fast method of input becomes a thing.  But I wouldn’t want to bet against it either :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had been debating with him about a tool he’s building and talking about how important I think the iPad is and he is disagreeing.  I get it.  It took me a long time to grok the overall nature of an iPad but I think I finally have it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I write this I’m on vacation and the family is at rest (it’s a little past 5).  I’m doing my normal vacation thing - making progress on a recreational coding project.  Here’s what my “desk” looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/ymU9Fng.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/ymU9Fng.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the left is a Macbook and on the right is an iPad Air 2 wrapped in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Belkin-Ultimate-Wireless-Keyboard-Display/dp/B00BWHILCY&quot;&gt;Belkin keyboard case&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the Belkin case is an add on product so its hard to argue that its a general purpose productivity tool.  But what adding a keyboard case to your iPad does is make it into:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;1 pound micro laptop an 8+ hour battery with wireless connectivity anywhere you are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve used an iPad in this configuration to pull off the highway in the middle of absolutely nowhere West Virginia and ssh into a server to terminate a runaway process.  I didn’t have to worry about a separate data plan for my “real” laptop.  I didn’t have to worry about pairing my iPhone with laptop.  I just whipped out my iPad and used &lt;a href=&quot;https://panic.com/prompt/&quot;&gt;Prompt from Panic&lt;/a&gt;.  Even tho there are lots of places where I’m hesitant to bring a full fledged laptop, there’s pretty much nowhere these days where you can’t bring a tablet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s say that you don’t want to add a keyboard case to your iPad, well, there are still lots of productivity reasons to use an iPad aggressively:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Passwords.  Add a password manager like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enpass.io&quot;&gt;Enpass&lt;/a&gt; coupled with Dropbox and you can have all of your passwords with you everywhere.  That’s powerful.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goodnotesapp.com&quot;&gt;Good Notes&lt;/a&gt;.  Add a stylus and you have a pen based not taking solution for conferences where you can hold your iPad up, capture the projected screen and then add your own notes.  I saw this at ElixirConf and asked the individual (I forget his name but he was from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.basho.com/&quot;&gt;Basho&lt;/a&gt;; nice folks).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The app store in general.  It took me a long time to understand this but the cutting edge of software development no longer happens on OSX or Windows or even Linux.  Its happening at the app store level.  Now from a business perspective I find tying your business to this type of walled garden terrifying but developers are doing it in droves.  And you’re seeing real changes like that iOS Twitter clients seem to be updated more frequently than the OSX versions.  There are great productivity apps out there like Good Notes but you do have to look for them.  One great example is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener_ios.php&quot;&gt;Scrivener for iPad&lt;/a&gt; which has finally shipped.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There’s an aspect to modern productivity which doesn’t involve tons of data input - things like reviewing tweets, keeping up with your facebook feed, etc can readily be done on an iPad.  Any type of information consumption can arguably be done more easily on an iPad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Elixir Sips - Fantastic Customer Service</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of my quest to actually embrace Elixir as a working language for myself, I’ve taken a number of avenues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;conference&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;blog reading&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;blog writing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;podcasts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;books - currently up to 3; new favorite Elixir in Action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big part of the learning effort in any language is not just the language but the ecosystem as a whole.  You would correctly note that I’ve written relatively little elixir as of late.  As much as I’m still grokking the whole functional stuff, I’m also trying to understand the ecosystem.  Things like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;who the key people are&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the package system&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;relevant technical standards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;trying to get my head around core Erlang concepts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;conferences&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;application areas where Elixir shines&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;phoenix&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;phoenix presence - more important than I had ever suspected&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how testing works&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any programming language these days is the sum of its parts.  A great language can be crippled by a horrible package ecosystem or a great package library could be crippled by the language itself (cpan / perl).  And since I’ve spent 10+ years in Ruby now, I’m looking for my next “10 year language”.  And to make that type assessment means “look at the language of course but then look at everything”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that I haven’t done is explore screen casts.  A lot of what I know about Rails, I know from the late, lamented RailsCasts by Ryan Bates.  Back in 2007 or so it seemed like Ryan was changing the world with RailsCasts and for a lot of us, he really did.  Watching someone quickly and easily get ajax running in 2008 when it was still mysterious seemed like magic.  So its accurate to say that I have a lot of love for the medium of screencasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elixirsips.com/&quot;&gt;ElixirSips&lt;/a&gt; by Josh Adams, its fair to say that I was pretty damn overjoyed.  And then I started digging in and I was initially disappointed.  Being a beginner, I wanted to start at the beginning so I hit one of the free podcasts near the start and I had, well, issues.  So I did it again.  Same thing.  And then again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally I drafted an email to Josh Adams and said what amounts to “Dude - am I dumb or does your stuff not really work?”.  And much to my surprise I got a fantastically written email owning up to the problem and actually agreeing.  What he said was that he has a strong audience with ElixirSips that has moved past the intro stuff and he doesn’t want to let them down by taking the time to update the early work – &lt;strong&gt;even though he knows he’d make more money by doing just that&lt;/strong&gt;.  Wow.  Now that’s customer service and loyalty to your installed base.  Dang!  So heres what I did:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Subscribe!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does it meet all my needs as an absolute newbie?  Today, no.  However Josh is listening which is key and I think he’s going to get there.  &lt;strong&gt;Recommended&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Importance of Inserting NO-OPs Into Your Programming Day</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the better development techniques that I’ve ever found has nothing to do with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;programming language&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;editor / tools&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;methodology&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;anything internet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is what I refer to as a &lt;strong&gt;personal no op&lt;/strong&gt;.  A &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP&quot;&gt;no op is an assembly language instruction&lt;/a&gt; that does nothing and since I Z-80 assembly was my second language, I feel comfortable using term.  A personal no op is when you know that you’re about to go dangerously down the wrong path and you decide “All righty then – time to leave the keyboard before I screw something up.”  This is one of those lessons that you only get by experience and, yes, it is a bit of a gray beard thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me illustrate with an example.  I’ve been wrestling with a data indexing issue with respect to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sphinxsearch.com&quot;&gt;Sphinx Search&lt;/a&gt; and a very large data set.  The time cost of an end to end index is about 20+ hours and, in the process, it trashes the previous index making previous to current comparisons hard if not impossible.  So what did I do?  I went upstairs and I made a sandwich.  And since I wanted a sandwich based on last night’s meatballs and we were all out of tomato sauce, I thought nothing of grabbing a can of tomatoes and cooking them down with spices and a bit of sugar.  And, all the while, I was thinking these issues thru, partially in the foreground and partially in the background.  And, sure enough, as the sauce neared completion, the answer came to me.  I won’t bore you with the details but the answer lies in an arcane aspect of how we do database sharding.  With a handful of new models and some code injected dynamically I should be able to preserve old and new indices concurrently.  And now I’m back at my desk writing this up and getting read to code it together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the harder truths to recognize as a software engineer is that you’re not actually a typist.  You’re not even actually a programmer.  If you really are an engineer then all your real work happens in your own head and typing it out is just a side effect.  Being a software engineer isn’t all that different I would argue from being an attorney.  Just as an attorney’s real work happens not with Lexis / Nexis / Microsoft Word but in his or her head, so too does your work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the next time you’re struggling with something, get away from the keyboard and take a personal no op.  It really does help.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tutorial - Sideloading Content in iBooks on an iPhone or iPad</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As I’ve written previously, I find the iPhone Sync process to be the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fuzzygroup.github.io/blog/iphone/2016/09/07/dear-apple-please-make-itunes-sync-suck-less.html&quot;&gt;very devil itself&lt;/a&gt;.  Not wanting to use the formal sync process has taught me a few tricks including how to use Dropbox for photos and how to side load ebooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sideloading is the industry term for getting something onto a device in a less than approved manner.  Here’s what to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You need an iBooks compatible resource on the public internet as a url - PDF or ePub work great and ePub is preferable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to that url in Safari on your iPhone or iPad; if the url is long and complex then use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tinyurl.com/&quot;&gt;TinyUrl&lt;/a&gt; on your machine with a real keyboard to make a tiny version of the url which will work just fine&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When Safari opens the url, select the “Open in iBooks” link in the upper right&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will load the url into iBooks and show you your new book at the top of your bookshelf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t have a ebook to try this with?  Here’s a fascinating book on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.robertgaskins.com/powerpoint-history/sweating-bullets/gaskins-sweating-bullets-webpdf-isbn-9780985142414.pdf&quot;&gt;history of PowerPoint&lt;/a&gt; and it is a great, great read!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>AWS Tutorial 0x - Using SSH Config to Make Access Easier</title>

        <title>Software Worth Purchasing 01 - Acorn</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you know me as a developer then you know that I’m, well, text centric.  I’m a back end guy living in a front end world so to speak and I lack, ahem, &lt;strong&gt;any graphical skills whatsoever&lt;/strong&gt;.  To this day my favorite graphic tools are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deluxe Paint under Dos&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;JASC’s Paint Shop Pro 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you can count on the fingers of 2 hands the number of edited screenshots / png files that I’ve made personally since about 1996 when those tools passed from this computing world.  &lt;em&gt;sniff; alas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I’ve been re-doing my personal tool stack recently and I thought it might be interesting to document the process hence this post and subsequent add on posts.  My first choice for “Software Worth Purchasing” is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flyingmeat.com/acorn/&quot;&gt;Flying Meat Software’s Acorn 5.5&lt;/a&gt;.  They describe it as a “Image Editor for Humans” and I can attest to that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m human&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I can use it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m graphically challenged at best and when I was able to use it add basic, albeit bad looking, arrows to my latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://fuzzygroup.github.io/blog/aws/2016/09/11/aws-tutorial-07-understanding-elastic-ips.html&quot;&gt;aws tutorial&lt;/a&gt;, I was delighted.  Its very possible that there is a nice arrows feature inside the product but the fact that I was able to open an image and make basic changes without worrying about layers, crazy file formats, wondering where the damn scroll bars went*.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the best commentary I can make about this is &lt;strong&gt;it works like Mac software is supposed to work&lt;/strong&gt;.  In the process of writing this I had to modify the image below to remove my serial number and even though I am graphically challenged I was still able to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;remove a region of the image&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;find the dropper&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;get the right color&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;zoom in&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;fill in the region&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;save it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they have that level of quintessential grace and style that a small, independent Mac company is supposed to have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/acorn_has_class.png&quot; alt=&quot;acorn_has_class.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;I cannot say how delighted I am with Acorn.  Utterly, massively recommended!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*That one’s a commentary about &lt;a href=&quot;https://sketchapp.com&quot;&gt;Sketch&lt;/a&gt; which is a brilliant product seemingly but where the hell did the scrollbars go - how am I supposed to intuit how to pan around a large virtual workspace???&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Turn off Flash on Safari</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Well I just got to start my recreational vacation coding by dealing with my MacBook going completely nuts and coming close to a full power cycle.  I hate power cycling my hardware.  A quick trip to Activity Monitor showed the issue was Flash support in Safari so its time to go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Safari Menu&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preferences&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Security tab&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Internet Plugins Settings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Uncheck Flash Adobe Flash Player&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
