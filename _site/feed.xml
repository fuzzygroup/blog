        <title>Is an iPad a Serious Productivity Tool?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I just had a friend email me something including this text:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will be interesting to see how the iPad unfolds.  I find it hard to believe it’ll be a serious productivity tool until voice rec or a fast method of input becomes a thing.  But I wouldn’t want to bet against it either :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had been debating with him about a tool he’s building and talking about how important I think the iPad is and he is disagreeing.  I get it.  It took me a long time to grok the overall nature of an iPad but I think I finally have it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I write this I’m on vacation and the family is at rest (it’s a little past 5).  I’m doing my normal vacation thing - making progress on a recreational coding project.  Here’s what my “desk” looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/ymU9Fng.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/ymU9Fng.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the left is a Macbook and on the right is an iPad Air 2 wrapped in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Belkin-Ultimate-Wireless-Keyboard-Display/dp/B00BWHILCY&quot;&gt;Belkin keyboard case&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the Belkin case is an add on product so its hard to argue that its a general purpose productivity tool.  But what adding a keyboard case to your iPad does is make it into:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;1 pound micro laptop an 8+ hour battery with wireless connectivity anywhere you are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve used an iPad in this configuration to pull off the highway in the middle of absolutely nowhere West Virginia and ssh into a server to terminate a runaway process.  I didn’t have to worry about a separate data plan for my “real” laptop.  I didn’t have to worry about pairing my iPhone with laptop.  I just whipped out my iPad and used &lt;a href=&quot;https://panic.com/prompt/&quot;&gt;Prompt from Panic&lt;/a&gt;.  Even tho there are lots of places where I’m hesitant to bring a full fledged laptop, there’s pretty much nowhere these days where you can’t bring a tablet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s say that you don’t want to add a keyboard case to your iPad, well, there are still lots of productivity reasons to use an iPad aggressively:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Passwords.  Add a password manager like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enpass.io&quot;&gt;Enpass&lt;/a&gt; coupled with Dropbox and you can have all of your passwords with you everywhere.  That’s powerful.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goodnotesapp.com&quot;&gt;Good Notes&lt;/a&gt;.  Add a stylus and you have a pen based not taking solution for conferences where you can hold your iPad up, capture the projected screen and then add your own notes.  I saw this at ElixirConf and asked the individual (I forget his name but he was from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.basho.com/&quot;&gt;Basho&lt;/a&gt;; nice folks).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The app store in general.  It took me a long time to understand this but the cutting edge of software development no longer happens on OSX or Windows or even Linux.  Its happening at the app store level.  Now from a business perspective I find tying your business to this type of walled garden terrifying but developers are doing it in droves.  And you’re seeing real changes like that iOS Twitter clients seem to be updated more frequently than the OSX versions.  There are great productivity apps out there like Good Notes but you do have to look for them.  One great example is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener_ios.php&quot;&gt;Scrivener for iPad&lt;/a&gt; which has finally shipped.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There’s an aspect to modern productivity which doesn’t involve tons of data input - things like reviewing tweets, keeping up with your facebook feed, etc can readily be done on an iPad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>The Importance of Inserting NO-OPs Into Your Programming Day</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the better development techniques that I’ve ever found has nothing to do with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;programming language&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;editor / tools&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;methodology&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;anything internet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is what I refer to as a &lt;strong&gt;personal no op&lt;/strong&gt;.  A &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP&quot;&gt;no op is an assembly language instruction&lt;/a&gt; that does nothing and since I Z-80 assembly was my second language, I feel comfortable using term.  A personal no op is when you know that you’re about to go dangerously down the wrong path and you decide “All righty then – time to leave the keyboard before I screw something up.”  This is one of those lessons that you only get by experience and, yes, it is a bit of a gray beard thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me illustrate with an example.  I’ve been wrestling with a data indexing issue with respect to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sphinxsearch.com&quot;&gt;Sphinx Search&lt;/a&gt; and a very large data set.  The time cost of an end to end index is about 20+ hours and, in the process, it trashes the previous index making previous to current comparisons hard if not impossible.  So what did I do?  I went upstairs and I made a sandwich.  And since I wanted a sandwich based on last night’s meatballs and we were all out of tomato sauce, I thought nothing of grabbing a can of tomatoes and cooking them down with spices and a bit of sugar.  And, all the while, I was thinking these issues thru, partially in the foreground and partially in the background.  And, sure enough, as the sauce neared completion, the answer came to me.  I won’t bore you with the details but the answer lies in an arcane aspect of how we do database sharding.  With a handful of new models and some code injected dynamically I should be able to preserve old and new indices concurrently.  And now I’m back at my desk writing this up and getting read to code it together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the harder truths to recognize as a software engineer is that you’re not actually a typist.  You’re not even actually a programmer.  If you really are an engineer then all your real work happens in your own head and typing it out is just a side effect.  Being a software engineer isn’t all that different I would argue from being an attorney.  Just as an attorney’s real work happens not with Lexis / Nexis / Microsoft Word but in his or her head, so too does your work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the next time you’re struggling with something, get away from the keyboard and take a personal no op.  It really does help.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tutorial - Sideloading Content in iBooks on an iPhone or iPad</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As I’ve written previously, I find the iPhone Sync process to be the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fuzzygroup.github.io/blog/iphone/2016/09/07/dear-apple-please-make-itunes-sync-suck-less.html&quot;&gt;very devil itself&lt;/a&gt;.  Not wanting to use the formal sync process has taught me a few tricks including how to use Dropbox for photos and how to side load ebooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sideloading is the industry term for getting something onto a device in a less than approved manner.  Here’s what to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You need an iBooks compatible resource on the public internet as a url - PDF or ePub work great and ePub is preferable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to that url in Safari on your iPhone or iPad; if the url is long and complex then use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tinyurl.com/&quot;&gt;TinyUrl&lt;/a&gt; on your machine with a real keyboard to make a tiny version of the url which will work just fine&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When Safari opens the url, select the “Open in iBooks” link in the upper right&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will load the url into iBooks and show you your new book at the top of your bookshelf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t have a ebook to try this with?  Here’s a fascinating book on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.robertgaskins.com/powerpoint-history/sweating-bullets/gaskins-sweating-bullets-webpdf-isbn-9780985142414.pdf&quot;&gt;history of PowerPoint&lt;/a&gt; and it is a great, great read!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>AWS Tutorial 0x - Using SSH Config to Make Access Easier</title>

        <title>Software Worth Purchasing 01 - Acorn</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you know me as a developer then you know that I’m, well, text centric.  I’m a back end guy living in a front end world so to speak and I lack, ahem, &lt;strong&gt;any graphical skills whatsoever&lt;/strong&gt;.  To this day my favorite graphic tools are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deluxe Paint under Dos&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;JASC’s Paint Shop Pro 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you can count on the fingers of 2 hands the number of edited screenshots / png files that I’ve made personally since about 1996 when those tools passed from this computing world.  &lt;em&gt;sniff; alas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I’ve been re-doing my personal tool stack recently and I thought it might be interesting to document the process hence this post and subsequent add on posts.  My first choice for “Software Worth Purchasing” is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flyingmeat.com/acorn/&quot;&gt;Flying Meat Software’s Acorn 5.5&lt;/a&gt;.  They describe it as a “Image Editor for Humans” and I can attest to that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m human&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I can use it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m graphically challenged at best and when I was able to use it add basic, albeit bad looking, arrows to my latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://fuzzygroup.github.io/blog/aws/2016/09/11/aws-tutorial-07-understanding-elastic-ips.html&quot;&gt;aws tutorial&lt;/a&gt;, I was delighted.  Its very possible that there is a nice arrows feature inside the product but the fact that I was able to open an image and make basic changes without worrying about layers, crazy file formats, wondering where the damn scroll bars went*.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the best commentary I can make about this is &lt;strong&gt;it works like Mac software is supposed to work&lt;/strong&gt;.  In the process of writing this I had to modify the image below to remove my serial number and even though I am graphically challenged I was still able to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;remove a region of the image&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;find the dropper&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;get the right color&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;zoom in&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;fill in the region&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;save it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they have that level of quintessential grace and style that a small, independent Mac company is supposed to have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/acorn_has_class.png&quot; alt=&quot;acorn_has_class.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;I cannot say how delighted I am with Acorn.  Utterly, massively recommended!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*That one’s a commentary about &lt;a href=&quot;https://sketchapp.com&quot;&gt;Sketch&lt;/a&gt; which is a brilliant product seemingly but where the hell did the scrollbars go - how am I supposed to intuit how to pan around a large virtual workspace???&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Turn off Flash on Safari</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Well I just got to start my recreational vacation coding by dealing with my MacBook going completely nuts and coming close to a full power cycle.  I hate power cycling my hardware.  A quick trip to Activity Monitor showed the issue was Flash support in Safari so its time to go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Safari Menu&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preferences&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Security tab&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Internet Plugins Settings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Uncheck Flash Adobe Flash Player&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>AWS Tutorial 07 - Understanding Elastic IPs</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Any ec2 instance, let’s call it a node for simplicity’s sake, in AWS has a number of network settings that define how you access it.  Here’s an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/aws/aws_tutorial_07.png&quot; alt=&quot;aws_tutorial_07.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this box has both a public IP and a public DNS address.  And these are how you access the node - until its restarted.  At which point the node will be assigned a fresh IP address and a matching DNS address.  And, at this point, your SSH settings / browser settings for accessing that box need to be reset.  And if you’re using an SSH config file to make accessing the box easy, well, you have to change it.  And that &lt;strong&gt;sucks&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key here is to assign an Elastic IP Address to the box so a consistent ip address and matching domain name is persistently attached to the node so even if you restart it / resize it / etc, you can always access it in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to do that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In your AWS console goto &lt;a href=&quot;https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home#Instances:sort=instanceState&quot;&gt;EC2 instances&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Look along the left hand table of contents bar until you find Network and Security and click &lt;a href=&quot;https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?#Addresses:sort=publicIp&quot;&gt;Elastic IPs&lt;/a&gt; and you should see something like this:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/aws/aws_tutorial_07_elastic_ip.png&quot; alt=&quot;aws_tutorial_07.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click Allocate New Address.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Answer Yes and you’ll get this:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/aws/aws_tutorial_07_elastic_ip_allocate_succeeded.png&quot; alt=&quot;aws_tutorial_07.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go up to the actions menu and click Associate Address:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/aws/aws_tutorial_07_elastic_ip_associate.png&quot; alt=&quot;aws_tutorial_07.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start to type in the name tag of the node or another way to identify it:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/aws/aws_tutorial_07_elastic_ip_05.png&quot; alt=&quot;aws_tutorial_07.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/aws/aws_tutorial_07_elastic_ip_06.png&quot; alt=&quot;aws_tutorial_07.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/aws/aws_tutorial_07_elastic_ip_07.png&quot; alt=&quot;aws_tutorial_07.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, wham!  Your box now has a permanent IP address associated with it.  You can now use that for SSH / DNS / SSH config files, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some issues with Elastic IPs that you need to understand:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Setting an elastic IP releases your current public IP so if you’re used to that you need to take note&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You get allocated only 5 free elastic IPs with you account.  After that you pay for them so use wisely&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You might be able to get around the limit of 5 by taking a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=dynamic+dns+for+AWS&amp;amp;oq=dynamic+dns+for+AWS&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.3735j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;&gt;dynamic DNS approach&lt;/a&gt; but I haven’t explored that myself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Howto - Upgrading Elixir to 1.3 on OSX</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So I realized that even though I’m just getting started, I’m already behind.  &lt;em&gt;chuckle&lt;/em&gt;.  Here you go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;elixir --version
Erlang/OTP 18 [erts-7.3] [source] [64-bit] [smp:4:4] [async-threads:10] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false] [dtrace]

Elixir 1.2.4
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it is the normal brew process (you type what’s in bold):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;**brew update**
  
**brew upgrade elixir**
  
elixir --version
  
elixir --version
Erlang/OTP 19 [erts-8.0.2] [source] [64-bit] [smp:4:4] [async-threads:10] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false] [dtrace]

Elixir 1.3.2  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>CodeTree Rebuttal on Buying a SAAS App</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kareem&quot;&gt;Kareem Mayan&lt;/a&gt; and his co-founders over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codetree.com&quot;&gt;CodeTree&lt;/a&gt; recently wrote an interesting piece - &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.codetree.com/articles/a-framework-for-picking-and-funding-your-business-idea.html&quot;&gt;A Framework for picking and funding your business idea&lt;/a&gt; and this is really a great piece.  It is refreshingly analytical and methodical in terms of picking your opportunity.  Personally I’m more of a technologist than full on business guy so I learned quite a bit about discipline from this.  However, there’s one aspect of it I wanted to comment on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The reason for buying small SaaS businesses is that it’s so hard to start anything from scratch. Even a business doing only $5,000 in MRR has validated something significant, and that makes the business valuable.” 
- &lt;a href=&quot;http://hiten.com/issues/97&quot;&gt;Hiten Shah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intellectually I agree with this and it is one of the &lt;strong&gt;exact&lt;/strong&gt; reasons that I bought a SAAS business in May of 2015.  While I can’t disclose the particular business but, after buying it, I saw sales largely collapse by a factor of 6x over a 18 month period and I thought discussing why might be interesting.  Here’s what went wrong:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;loss-of-marketing&quot;&gt;Loss of Marketing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I bought this business I did not realize how strongly it was generating its sales as a function of inherent web traffic it got from other things the previous owner did.  And I don’t think that there was a way to actually know this which bothers me to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;inability-to-generate-new-sales-from-google-ads&quot;&gt;Inability to Generate New Sales from Google Ads&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people on the web think “need sales - I know, I’ll run google ads!”.  What I found is that Google ads are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;far harder to make work than you think&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;make damn sure that you look at the when / where settings on Google ads.  We lost a bunch of money due to our ads being shown globally instead of US only / EST to PST since that’s where like 95% of our sales came from.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;have a lot more complexity now (2015 / 2016) than that did even 2 years ago&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;don’t work all that well if the monthly price of your SAAS is at the multiple hundreds of dollars point&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;can be used aggressively against you - you run an ad and your bigger competitors can simply outspend you&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;finding a vendor who can actually help you with google ads is hard.  Lots of people want to help you but few of them seem to be any good.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;not everything can be sold via adwords.  One of the new products we released was a market research report that we later found out was on a topic area which could not be advertised on Adwords.  My co-founder headed this up and the inability to market it was killer for us since we had planned this effort as a loss leader to jump start subscription sales.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;big-competitors-can-be-deadly&quot;&gt;Big Competitors Can Be Deadly&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a market space with one really big competitor and in any competitive market space if the market leader decides to, well, they can make things very, very hard for you.  What we found is that however we spent on Adwords, they would match it and boost the click thru price.  It isn’t illegal, immoral or fattening but it did &lt;strong&gt;feel wrong&lt;/strong&gt;.  And that’s not even talking about the disastrous impact that can hit your business if competitors decide to maliciously click on your ads and run up your bill / prevent traffic from getting to you.  I know that this isn’t supposed to happen but when you’re at the small, small, small side of Adwords and you’re trying to figure out what works, your budgets aren’t large.  This means that a sharp competitor might see the keywords you’re running and just plain screw with you.  And you’ll never know but since you are using a test marketing budget what you see is “Keyword X brought in no sales; guess it is time to move onto the next one”.  And maybe it was exactly the right keyword.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;take-aways&quot;&gt;Take Aways&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;See if you can answer the question “If this SAAS business leaves its current owner, what does the business lose in web traffic, referrals and other things - does that make the business less viable?”  And don’t forget that a lot of web traffic these days comes from a founder’s personal blog / web presence.  If you just look at corporate web traffic, you ignore that.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If your plan is to use Google Ads as a mechanism for sales then &lt;strong&gt;spend your own money,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;before the acquisition&lt;/em&gt;, to verify that Google Ads actually work for this business.  I’m still kicking myself daily that I didn’t focus on generating new sales and test Google Ads for this.  Even spending a thousand dollars out of pocket prior to the acquisition might have saved me far, far more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t ignore social media.  When all this was going on, I did not focus on content marketing - blogging / tweeting.  I wish that I had and I wonder how it would have turned out.  However, at the time, I had my hands full with migrating the data center and revitalizing a code base that the previous owner had neglected.  Sigh; too little time; too many bytes to push around.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be careful about large entrenched competitors.  I’ve always been from the school of thought - small and nimble can win the race.  This is only so true these days.  When the number of engineers that they have dwarfs you by an order of magnitude or more, well, that’s going to hurt. I seem to have bought this just at an inflection point where their funding jumped and I got hit in the crossfire.  Sigh.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>A Template for Rails 5 Apps with MySQL, Capistrano, Devise</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite my recent focus on Elixir, I still make most of my money doing Rails.  Here’s a template that &lt;a href=&quot;http://dasari.me/&quot;&gt;Dv&lt;/a&gt; and I put together yesterday for a modern Rails 5 app:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Devise&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MySQL&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Capistrano&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Docker (not entirely finished yet but it is a start)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fuzzygroup/baseline_devise_template&quot;&gt;GitHub Template for a new Rails App&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fork it, clone it, bundle install and the like.  Enjoy.  I’ve done this so many times recently that I thought it was better to do it once and then use that as a baseline moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes on Devise&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re trying to understand Devise and how its changed in Rails 5 then you’ll need these links:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sitepoint.com/devise-authentication-in-depth/&quot;&gt;https://www.sitepoint.com/devise-authentication-in-depth/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://launchschool.com/blog/how-to-use-devise-in-rails-for-authentication&quot;&gt;https://launchschool.com/blog/how-to-use-devise-in-rails-for-authentication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/plataformatec/devise&quot;&gt;https://github.com/plataformatec/devise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally I have a love / hate relationship with Devise.  It always feels hard to get started (part of the reason I made a template) but I have huge respect for the degree of outstanding great work, love and care that &lt;a href=&quot;http://plataformatec.com.br/&quot;&gt;Platformatec&lt;/a&gt; put into it.&lt;/p&gt;
