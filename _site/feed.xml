        <title>Linux Tip of the Day - git recall</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Every so often your boss asks you what you’ve been working on and if you have been all over a code base it can actually be hard to break it down.  The new git recall command actually makes this pretty easy.  This is a new Linux tool I just learned about - &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Fakerr/git-recall&quot;&gt;Docs&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13517486&quot;&gt;Hacker News Discussion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install it on Linux as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;npm install –global git-recall&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install it on OSX as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;brew install less&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-or- you might need to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;brew install homebrew/dupes/less&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: I know you already have less installed on your system.  You need lesskey which git recall relies on but Apple, unhelpfully, &lt;a href=&quot;http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/27269/is-less1-missing-lesskey-functionality&quot;&gt;did not include&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have lesskey then you need to install git recall itself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;npm install –global git-recall&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you change into a directory where you’re working on something git, do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;git recall&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial view shows you your commits in a recent time frame:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/git_recall1.png&quot; alt=&quot;git_recall_.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can go up and down the list and select a commit that you’re interested in with the arrow keys and enter or j/k and enter.  I had issues with the arrow keys so keep j/k in mind.  Then you’ll see the commit details:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>20 Days of Zero</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Note: This really is about weight loss and I’ll even show much much I lost but I’m looking at this from a startup context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I generally find people’s second act in the startup world far, far more interesting than people’s first act.  By second act, of course, I am referring to when an entrepreneur tries to replicate the lightning in a bottle experience that they initially had when they built a startup.  Second acts seem to almost always be less successful than people’s first act.  Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Hawkins&quot;&gt;Jeff Hawkins&lt;/a&gt; who built Palm and then Handspring into a multi billion success is now working on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numenta&quot;&gt;Numenta&lt;/a&gt; software that mimic human memory – and he’s been at it for more than a decade&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Charles Ferguson who built Vermeer, the original creators of FrontPage, left high tech entirely and is now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Ferguson_(filmmaker)&quot;&gt;film maker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen&quot;&gt;Marc Andreessen&lt;/a&gt; who created Netscape then created Opsware and is now a Venture capitalist&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rose&quot;&gt;Kevin Rose&lt;/a&gt; founded Digg which although it is much forgotten these days was once upon a time beating Reddit in the social space.  He then did Pownce and is now doing an app called Zero for weight loss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that, dear reader, brings us to Kevin Rose and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@kevinrose/introducing-zero-a-new-app-to-help-you-fast-209935e8245d&quot;&gt;Zero&lt;/a&gt;.  Zero is a new app for what is termed Intermittent Fasting (IF) which is a technique where you fast for a long stretch of the day on an ongoing basis.  Here’s what the app looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/873/1*C9hnNf_51CYUoTl_MFBeYA.png&quot; alt=&quot;Zero App&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve now been using Zero since 1/7 so I have 20 days on it which I think is enough to make some comments.  On 1/7 I weighed in at 194 which isn’t an all time high for me but does reflect, well, post Christmas and Holiday weight gain.  I certainly wasn’t fat by any means but I felt larger than I wanted to be.  After showing my wife Zero we made the joint decision to go on Zero.  My wife suffers from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease&quot;&gt;Celiac disease&lt;/a&gt; in a fairly bad way and by the after Christmas period she was in pretty much constant stomach pain.  Zero, at the time, seemed like a fairly rational decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s my weight metrics, unsophisticated as they are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/weight_metrics.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;weight_metrics.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: This was originally written late last week which is why the day count is slightly different.  I’ve lost about another pound since this was written but it wasn’t worth updating the picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I started Zero I have lost almost 10 pounds which for a 49 year old man is, I think, fairly good.  The only real goal I had at the start of this was a Gandalf like approach to buying new jeans.  When I found out, post Christmas, that my jeans didn’t fit all that well, I took the position:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Thou Shalt Not Buy Bigger Pants! (Gandalf to a group of fat hobbits)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am happy to report that no new jeans have been purchased and their fit is much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;adding-whole-30-to-zero&quot;&gt;Adding Whole 30 to Zero&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot say that all of this is tied to Zero.  On 1/15 one of my wife’s good friends, H, convinced her to go on &lt;a href=&quot;http://whole30.com/&quot;&gt;Whole 30&lt;/a&gt; and I came along for the chaos.  Whole30 is one of those diets where you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;drink no alcohol&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;no sugar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;no preservatives&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;no dairy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;no corn&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;no carbs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;eat only things you cook yourself&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;eat only meats and vegetables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that I cook everything from scratch already this basically amounted to slight modifications to what I already cook.  I’ve never drank so the alcohol restrictions amounted to “don’t put wine in the beef stew made yesterday” and didn’t affect me at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while I can’t say that all of this is due to Zero, I think the bulk of the weight loss is attributable to the Zero’s Intermittent Fasting approach.  By reducing the window of time during which you can eat down to say 7 to 8 hours, my wife and I have gone from two large meals (lunch and dinner) generally down to 1 (lunch) and a snack (dinner).  So from a weight loss perspective, I suspect the reduction in overall food volume is a bigger contributor than the foods I’ve taken out of my diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I’ve been fairly pleased with Whole 30 as a approach to food.  My wife’s constant stomach pains are gone so that’s a huge win from my perspective.  That was why I agreed to go on it and it has been a complete success in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the Whole 30  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0544854411?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=whole3009c-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0544854411&quot;&gt;cookbook&lt;/a&gt; isn’t all that good.  The recipes fall into that difficult, pretentious category of recipe where my comment would generally be “trying too hard”.  Additionally some of the recipes are flat out either bad or wrong (don’t try to make mayonaise their way; go get &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Food-Lab-Cooking-Through-Science/dp/0393081087/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1485516745&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=kenji+lopez+alt&quot;&gt;Kenji’s book&lt;/a&gt;) or follow &lt;a href=&quot;http://thepioneerwoman.com/food-and-friends/how-to-make-mayonnaise/&quot;&gt;the Pioneer Woman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;comments-on-the-zero-app&quot;&gt;Comments on the Zero App&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Zero app is very much no nonsense – you get a calendar and a few different options for scheduling your fasts and that’s it.  And that’s my biggest problem with it – there’s no way to add your own data to the fast.  I would have very much liked it if say you could attach a picture of each meal you ate to each day.  Or if you could put in a weight metric.  Or if you could put in how you felt.  I’d love to know how many days of Zero it took for my wife to feel better but I have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still Zero led to me losing 10 pounds and that’s nothing to disregard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do get some summary metrics – I can see my average fast time was 16h 49m and that on average I ate for only 6 minutes during the night (I was using the Circadian approach to fasting).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;getting-zero&quot;&gt;Getting Zero&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zero can be gotten from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zero-fasting-tracker/id1168348542?mt=8&quot;&gt;App Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;getting-whole30&quot;&gt;Getting Whole30&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My recommendation would be to just get the baseline &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Whole30-30-Day-Guide-Health-Freedom/dp/0544609719&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; and then ignore their whole philosophy and just focus on the food aspect of it.  Diets, these days, generally seem to be as much guru advice as they are diet and, honestly, I doubt you need a guru.  I know I don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;overall&quot;&gt;Overall&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zero is ridiculously simple to use does make it easy to stick with a fast.  Pairing Zero with Whole30 did seem to produce, at least for me, overall weight loss and, I think, some health gains.  Recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Linux Tip of the Day - Use ncdu for Disc Space Usage</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If I was to look back over the time I’ve spent doing sys admin work, I would guess that I’ve spent more time singing the song:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Where oh here has my disc space gone, Where oh where could it be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;than anything else.  Managing storage just plain &lt;strong&gt;sucks&lt;/strong&gt;.  And ever since we moved from hard discs to first SSDs and now cloud boxes with 8 gig partitions, well, its a bigger issue than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Linux and OSX tool ncdu actually makes this pretty easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install on Linux it as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;sudo apt-get install ncdu&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install on OSX it as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;brew install ncdu&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start it as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;ncdu&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you will get a character mode interface you can move with the arrow keys to get a better feel for the disc space.  Here are some screen shots:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/ncdu1.png&quot; alt=&quot;ncdu1.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/ncdu2.png&quot; alt=&quot;ncdu2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/ncdu3.png&quot; alt=&quot;ncdu3.png&quot; /&gt;

        <title>Linux Tip of the Day - Use bmon for Bandwidth Monitoring</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently was trying to upload several terabytes of data over to AWS’ S3 file storage.  Given that inbound transfers to S3 are actually free, this wasn’t as pricey as it might seem.  The transfer seemed slow so &lt;a href=&quot;http://nickjanetakis.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/a&gt; suggested using Bandwidth Monitoring software, an obvious thing, but something I didn’t even know existed.  The tool Nick recommended was bmon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install it as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;sudo apt-get install bmon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start it as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;bmon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you can see:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Choosing Account Software For Your Freelance Life</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m in the process of gearing up for a return to the freelance lifestyle.  One thing I’ve never done, since I started as a real freelancer, is actually use accounting software.  I know, I know, I know – bad decision.  Well accounting and taxes are among my least favorite things in life so that’s why I’ve justified it but that’s kind of being a child about it.  Ignoring something does not make it better so one of my 2017 resolutions was “Deal with Accounting / Taxes”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;requirements&quot;&gt;Requirements&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my requirements for an accounting tool for freelancers in 2017:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cloud based / hosted&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ability to bill clients&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ability to record an invoice but NOT actually send it (I don’t necessarily want to lost X% to credit card processing)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;mobile app (ios)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ability to make an invoice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ability to record a client&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;time tracking is possibly desirable but unclear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;options&quot;&gt;Options&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked at three options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Quicken&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hurdlr&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;FreshBooks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://fuzzyblog.io/blog/assets/accounting_software.png&quot; alt=&quot;accounting_software.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quickbooks&quot;&gt;QuickBooks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like, I suspect every other entrepreneur, I’ve used Quick Books in the past so it was my first stop along this path.  Sadly, for what should be such a strong product, I rejected it almost immediately.  The version I was examining was the very low end, $10 / month version, &lt;a href=&quot;https://quickbooks.intuit.com/var/pricing/&quot;&gt;Quick Books Self Employed&lt;/a&gt; - left most option.  Here’s what I found wrong with it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As a web product it is incredibly slow (to amuse myself, I tried holding my breath during page refreshes; sometimes I wasn’t able to)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is very, very limited. For example there wasn’t a way to cleanly track clients.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It felt like it had been designed poorly at best.  My guess is that the product manager has never been a freelancer him or herself and it really, really shows.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Just the fact that googling for QuickBooks self employed takes me to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://search2.quickbooks.com/get-quickbooks?gclid=Cj0KEQiAwrbEBRDqxqzMsrTGmogBEiQAeSE6ZQUoreXe38AFn6v2IcG49NYFmZBf527SNNUwB5lqGRsaAo5t8P8HAQ&amp;amp;s_kwcid=AL!2419!3!147086503826!p!!g!!quicken&amp;amp;ef_id=WIkw5QAABM0ZEIG4:20170129112821:s&quot;&gt;page where it isn’t even listed&lt;/a&gt; tells me that my business isn’t a priority for Intuit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is strong on the traditional tax side of things and that’s a plus but account software should help me run my business not just my taxes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hurdlr&quot;&gt;Hurdlr&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://hurdlr.com/&quot;&gt;Hurdlr&lt;/a&gt; somewhere and I’m intrigued by the promise and absolutely terrified by the reality.  This is a brand new app / website seemingly and they’re not even charging yet.  Sure I can use it for free – and what happens when they fail?  Can I get my data back?  Can I trust them with passwords to my bank account?  Will they stay in business?  They do a good job of talking the talk but I’m not going thru this selection process again.  I hate to not risk my efforts on a startup given my predilections for startups but this is just too risky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;freshbooks&quot;&gt;FreshBooks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly to me I ended up picking &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freshbooks.com/&quot;&gt;FreshBooks&lt;/a&gt; as my choice.  Here’s how it matched up against my criteria:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cloud based / hosted - &lt;strong&gt;YES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ability to bill clients - &lt;strong&gt;YES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ability to record an invoice but NOT actually send it - &lt;strong&gt;YES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;mobile app (ios) - &lt;strong&gt;YES&lt;/strong&gt;.  Please note that you want the Cloud Accounting app.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ability to make an invoice - &lt;strong&gt;YES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ability to record a client - &lt;strong&gt;YES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;time tracking is possibly desirable but unclear - &lt;strong&gt;YES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve had one problem so far - expense import brought in far more than I wanted but Support helped me out and did a great job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have the app on my phone; my wife has it on her phone and for the first time since I’ve been a freelancer, I have a heads up view as to the money that’s coming in.  Honestly it feels fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While FreshBooks was right for me, you may need more information.  I found very good info on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.carefulcents.com/&quot;&gt;CarefulCents.com&lt;/a&gt; site.&lt;/p&gt;
