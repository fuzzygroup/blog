        <title>The Importance of Inserting NO-OPs Into Your Programming Day</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the better development techniques that I’ve ever found has nothing to do with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;programming language&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;editor / tools&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;methodology&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;anything internet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is what I refer to as a &lt;strong&gt;personal no op&lt;/strong&gt;.  A &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP&quot;&gt;no op is an assembly language instruction&lt;/a&gt; that does nothing and since I Z-80 assembly was my second language, I feel comfortable using term.  A personal no op is when you know that you’re about to go dangerously down the wrong path and you decide “All righty then – time to leave the keyboard before I screw something up.”  This is one of those lessons that you only get by experience and, yes, it is a bit of a gray beard thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me illustrate with an example.  I’ve been wrestling with a data indexing issue with respect to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sphinxsearch.com&quot;&gt;Sphinx Search&lt;/a&gt; and a very large data set.  The time cost of an end to end index is about 20+ hours and, in the process, it trashes the previous index making previous to current comparisons hard if not impossible.  So what did I do?  I went upstairs and I made a sandwich.  And since I wanted a sandwich based on last night’s meatballs and we were all out of tomato sauce, I thought nothing of grabbing a can of tomatoes and cooking them down with spices and a bit of sugar.  And, all the while, I was thinking these issues thru, partially in the foreground and partially in the background.  And, sure enough, as the sauce neared completion, the answer came to me.  I won’t bore you with the details but the answer lies in an arcane aspect of how we do database sharding.  With a handful of new models and some code injected dynamically I should be able to preserve old and new indices concurrently.  And now I’m back at my desk writing this up and getting read to code it together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the harder truths to recognize as a software engineer is that you’re not actually a typist.  You’re not even actually a programmer.  If you really are an engineer then all your real work happens in your own head and typing it out is just a side effect.  Being a software engineer isn’t all that different I would argue from being an attorney.  Just as an attorney’s real work happens not with Lexis / Nexis / Microsoft Word but in his or her head, so too does your work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the next time you’re struggling with something, get away from the keyboard and take a personal no op.  It really does help.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Software Worth Purchasing 01 - Acorn</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you know me as a developer then you know that I’m, well, text centric.  I’m a back end guy living in a front end world so to speak and I lack, ahem, &lt;strong&gt;any graphical skills whatsoever&lt;/strong&gt;.  To this day my favorite graphic tools are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deluxe Paint under Dos&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;JASC’s Paint Shop Pro 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you can count on the fingers of 2 hands the number of edited screenshots / png files that I’ve made personally since about 1996 when those tools passed from this computing world.  &lt;em&gt;sniff; alas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I’ve been re-doing my personal tool stack recently and I thought it might be interesting to document the process hence this post and subsequent add on posts.  My first choice for “Software Worth Purchasing” is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flyingmeat.com/acorn/&quot;&gt;Flying Meat Software’s Acorn 5.5&lt;/a&gt;.  They describe it as a “Image Editor for Humans” and I can attest to that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m human&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I can use it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m graphically challenged at best and when I was able to use it add basic, albeit bad looking, arrows to my latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://fuzzygroup.github.io/blog/aws/2016/09/11/aws-tutorial-07-understanding-elastic-ips.html&quot;&gt;aws tutorial&lt;/a&gt;, I was delighted.  Its very possible that there is a nice arrows feature inside the product but the fact that I was able to open an image and make basic changes without worrying about layers, crazy file formats, wondering where the damn scroll bars went*.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the best commentary I can make about this is &lt;strong&gt;it works like Mac software is supposed to work&lt;/strong&gt;.  In the process of writing this I had to modify the image below to remove my serial number and even though I am graphically challenged I was still able to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;remove a region of the image&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;find the dropper&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;get the right color&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;zoom in&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;fill in the region&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;save it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they have that level of quintessential grace and style that a small, independent Mac company is supposed to have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/acorn_has_class.png&quot; alt=&quot;acorn_has_class.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;I cannot say how delighted I am with Acorn.  Utterly, massively recommended!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*That one’s a commentary about &lt;a href=&quot;https://sketchapp.com&quot;&gt;Sketch&lt;/a&gt; which is a brilliant product seemingly but where the hell did the scrollbars go - how am I supposed to intuit how to pan around a large virtual workspace???&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Turn off Flash on Safari</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Well I just got to start my recreational vacation coding by dealing with my MacBook going completely nuts and coming close to a full power cycle.  I hate power cycling my hardware.  A quick trip to Activity Monitor showed the issue was Flash support in Safari so its time to go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Safari Menu&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preferences&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Security tab&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Internet Plugins Settings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Uncheck Flash Adobe Flash Player&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>AWS Tutorial 07 - Understanding Elastic IPs</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Any ec2 instance, let’s call it a node for simplicity’s sake, in AWS has a number of network settings that define how you access it.  Here’s an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/aws/aws_tutorial_07.png&quot; alt=&quot;aws_tutorial_07.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this box has both a public IP and a public DNS address.  And these are how you access the node - until its restarted.  At which point the node will be assigned a fresh IP address and a matching DNS address.  And, at this point, your SSH settings / browser settings for accessing that box need to be reset.  And if you’re using an SSH config file to make accessing the box easy, well, you have to change it.  And that &lt;strong&gt;sucks&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key here is to assign an Elastic IP Address to the box so a consistent ip address and matching domain name is persistently attached to the node so even if you restart it / resize it / etc, you can always access it in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to do that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In your AWS console goto &lt;a href=&quot;https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home#Instances:sort=instanceState&quot;&gt;EC2 instances&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Look along the left hand table of contents bar until you find Network and Security and click &lt;a href=&quot;https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?#Addresses:sort=publicIp&quot;&gt;Elastic IPs&lt;/a&gt; and you should see something like this:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/aws/aws_tutorial_07_elastic_ip.png&quot; alt=&quot;aws_tutorial_07.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click Allocate New Address.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Answer Yes and you’ll get this:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/aws/aws_tutorial_07_elastic_ip_allocate_succeeded.png&quot; alt=&quot;aws_tutorial_07.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go up to the actions menu and click Associate Address:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/aws/aws_tutorial_07_elastic_ip_associate.png&quot; alt=&quot;aws_tutorial_07.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start to type in the name tag of the node or another way to identify it:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/aws/aws_tutorial_07_elastic_ip_05.png&quot; alt=&quot;aws_tutorial_07.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/aws/aws_tutorial_07_elastic_ip_06.png&quot; alt=&quot;aws_tutorial_07.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/aws/aws_tutorial_07_elastic_ip_07.png&quot; alt=&quot;aws_tutorial_07.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, wham!  Your box now has a permanent IP address associated with it.  You can now use that for SSH / DNS / SSH config files, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some issues with Elastic IPs that you need to understand:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Setting an elastic IP releases your current public IP so if you’re used to that you need to take note&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You get allocated only 5 free elastic IPs with you account.  After that you pay for them so use wisely&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You might be able to get around the limit of 5 by taking a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=dynamic+dns+for+AWS&amp;amp;oq=dynamic+dns+for+AWS&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.3735j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;&gt;dynamic DNS approach&lt;/a&gt; but I haven’t explored that myself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Howto - Upgrading Elixir to 1.3 on OSX</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So I realized that even though I’m just getting started, I’m already behind.  &lt;em&gt;chuckle&lt;/em&gt;.  Here you go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;elixir --version
Erlang/OTP 18 [erts-7.3] [source] [64-bit] [smp:4:4] [async-threads:10] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false] [dtrace]

Elixir 1.2.4
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it is the normal brew process (you type what’s in bold):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;**brew update**
  
**brew upgrade elixir**
  
elixir --version
  
elixir --version
Erlang/OTP 19 [erts-8.0.2] [source] [64-bit] [smp:4:4] [async-threads:10] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false] [dtrace]

Elixir 1.3.2  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>CodeTree Rebuttal on Buying a SAAS App</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kareem&quot;&gt;Kareem Mayan&lt;/a&gt; and his co-founders over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codetree.com&quot;&gt;CodeTree&lt;/a&gt; recently wrote an interesting piece - &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.codetree.com/articles/a-framework-for-picking-and-funding-your-business-idea.html&quot;&gt;A Framework for picking and funding your business idea&lt;/a&gt; and this is really a great piece.  It is refreshingly analytical and methodical in terms of picking your opportunity.  Personally I’m more of a technologist than full on business guy so I learned quite a bit about discipline from this.  However, there’s one aspect of it I wanted to comment on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The reason for buying small SaaS businesses is that it’s so hard to start anything from scratch. Even a business doing only $5,000 in MRR has validated something significant, and that makes the business valuable.” 
- &lt;a href=&quot;http://hiten.com/issues/97&quot;&gt;Hiten Shah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intellectually I agree with this and it is one of the &lt;strong&gt;exact&lt;/strong&gt; reasons that I bought a SAAS business in May of 2015.  While I can’t disclose the particular business but, after buying it, I saw sales largely collapse by a factor of 6x over a 18 month period and I thought discussing why might be interesting.  Here’s what went wrong:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;loss-of-marketing&quot;&gt;Loss of Marketing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I bought this business I did not realize how strongly it was generating its sales as a function of inherent web traffic it got from other things the previous owner did.  And I don’t think that there was a way to actually know this which bothers me to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;inability-to-generate-new-sales-from-google-ads&quot;&gt;Inability to Generate New Sales from Google Ads&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people on the web think “need sales - I know, I’ll run google ads!”.  What I found is that Google ads are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;far harder to make work than you think&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;make damn sure that you look at the when / where settings on Google ads.  We lost a bunch of money due to our ads being shown globally instead of US only / EST to PST since that’s where like 95% of our sales came from.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;have a lot more complexity now (2015 / 2016) than that did even 2 years ago&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;don’t work all that well if the monthly price of your SAAS is at the multiple hundreds of dollars point&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;can be used aggressively against you - you run an ad and your bigger competitors can simply outspend you&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;finding a vendor who can actually help you with google ads is hard.  Lots of people want to help you but few of them seem to be any good.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;not everything can be sold via adwords.  One of the new products we released was a market research report that we later found out was on a topic area which could not be advertised on Adwords.  My co-founder headed this up and the inability to market it was killer for us since we had planned this effort as a loss leader to jump start subscription sales.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;big-competitors-can-be-deadly&quot;&gt;Big Competitors Can Be Deadly&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a market space with one really big competitor and in any competitive market space if the market leader decides to, well, they can make things very, very hard for you.  What we found is that however we spent on Adwords, they would match it and boost the click thru price.  It isn’t illegal, immoral or fattening but it did &lt;strong&gt;feel wrong&lt;/strong&gt;.  And that’s not even talking about the disastrous impact that can hit your business if competitors decide to maliciously click on your ads and run up your bill / prevent traffic from getting to you.  I know that this isn’t supposed to happen but when you’re at the small, small, small side of Adwords and you’re trying to figure out what works, your budgets aren’t large.  This means that a sharp competitor might see the keywords you’re running and just plain screw with you.  And you’ll never know but since you are using a test marketing budget what you see is “Keyword X brought in no sales; guess it is time to move onto the next one”.  And maybe it was exactly the right keyword.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;take-aways&quot;&gt;Take Aways&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;See if you can answer the question “If this SAAS business leaves its current owner, what does the business lose in web traffic, referrals and other things - does that make the business less viable?”  And don’t forget that a lot of web traffic these days comes from a founder’s personal blog / web presence.  If you just look at corporate web traffic, you ignore that.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If your plan is to use Google Ads as a mechanism for sales then &lt;strong&gt;spend your own money,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;before the acquisition&lt;/em&gt;, to verify that Google Ads actually work for this business.  I’m still kicking myself daily that I didn’t focus on generating new sales and test Google Ads for this.  Even spending a thousand dollars out of pocket prior to the acquisition might have saved me far, far more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t ignore social media.  When all this was going on, I did not focus on content marketing - blogging / tweeting.  I wish that I had and I wonder how it would have turned out.  However, at the time, I had my hands full with migrating the data center and revitalizing a code base that the previous owner had neglected.  Sigh; too little time; too many bytes to push around.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be careful about large entrenched competitors.  I’ve always been from the school of thought - small and nimble can win the race.  This is only so true these days.  When the number of engineers that they have dwarfs you by an order of magnitude or more, well, that’s going to hurt. I seem to have bought this just at an inflection point where their funding jumped and I got hit in the crossfire.  Sigh.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>A Template for Rails 5 Apps with MySQL, Capistrano, Devise</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite my recent focus on Elixir, I still make most of my money doing Rails.  Here’s a template that &lt;a href=&quot;http://dasari.me/&quot;&gt;Dv&lt;/a&gt; and I put together yesterday for a modern Rails 5 app:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Devise&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MySQL&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Capistrano&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Docker (not entirely finished yet but it is a start)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fuzzygroup/baseline_devise_template&quot;&gt;GitHub Template for a new Rails App&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fork it, clone it, bundle install and the like.  Enjoy.  I’ve done this so many times recently that I thought it was better to do it once and then use that as a baseline moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes on Devise&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re trying to understand Devise and how its changed in Rails 5 then you’ll need these links:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sitepoint.com/devise-authentication-in-depth/&quot;&gt;https://www.sitepoint.com/devise-authentication-in-depth/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://launchschool.com/blog/how-to-use-devise-in-rails-for-authentication&quot;&gt;https://launchschool.com/blog/how-to-use-devise-in-rails-for-authentication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/plataformatec/devise&quot;&gt;https://github.com/plataformatec/devise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally I have a love / hate relationship with Devise.  It always feels hard to get started (part of the reason I made a template) but I have huge respect for the degree of outstanding great work, love and care that &lt;a href=&quot;http://plataformatec.com.br/&quot;&gt;Platformatec&lt;/a&gt; put into it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Small World - CodeTree vs ZenHub for GitHub</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Note: I started this on the trip down to ElixirCon but failed to finish it then so its about a week out of date but still relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My father, a small businessman his whole life, has always commented to me on how the &lt;strong&gt;small&lt;/strong&gt; nature of any industry.  And he has always cautioned me to maintain an outstanding personal reputation for integrity because of that.  As I’m traveling down to ElixirCon and in line to buy a burrito, I see a notification on my phone “&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@kareem.m/how-to-avoid-building-a-company-that-youll-hate-d1eb76eb9a9d#.46ocftpmy&quot;&gt;Kareem Mayan published … &lt;/a&gt;” in the Medium app.  Wow.  It is a small world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the late, un-lamented eduFire, Kareem was the co-founder and one of two guys who hired me.  Because of him I dove ever more deeply into Ruby and took on Rails back in the pre 1.0 days.  He didn’t even balk, when on my second week on the job I came down with Pneumonia in the summer and spent a week incommunicado.  That was also the week that I finished all the Harry Potter books but thanks to the fever, I was still surprised in the last movie (really - he died; dang!).  Quite literally he changed my life for the better.  He also strongly encouraged our move from subversion to git which was hugely important.  Understanding version control is one of those seminal skills for a software developer and git made me better at it than I ever was with subversion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sidebar:&lt;/strong&gt; Say what you will about Ruby / Rails but I’ve been employed more than full time since 2007 due to Ruby / Rails and the $$$ I make from it have been transformative.  It has also leveled up my skills dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway I’m back in the market for real development tools with a new hire coming on board at my day job and what is Kareem doing?  Well he’s one of the people behind &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codetree.com/&quot;&gt;CodeTree&lt;/a&gt; which competes with the other tool I’m looking at, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zenhub.com&quot;&gt;ZenHub&lt;/a&gt;.  So it really is a small world - I haven’t thought about Kareem in probably 7 years now and all I knew was he went full “Digital Nomad” for quite a while.  And now he’s providing an interesting tool and one of the owners of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;** To the Comparison&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;marketing materials&lt;/strong&gt;.  CodeTree’s site looks awful on an iPhone.  That impacts nothing on the tool itself but when you’re considering tooling and looking the site on an iPhone, well, appearance counts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;browser support&lt;/strong&gt;.  ZenHub is tied heavily to Chrome as a browser.  That concerns me a lot because I use a bunch of different machines, iPad and such.  CodeTree doesn’t seem to have such limitations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pricing&lt;/strong&gt;.  Pricing is similar although CodeTree is more affordable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kareem reached out to me via email when he saw that I had signed up for a CodeTree trial.  This to me is a hugely good sign because it means that a real live person is reviewing every single new sales lead and considering them.  When I reached out to him and asked him some questions, here was his response:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two key reasons that people choose Codetree vs. Zenhub:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People who are responsible for delivery like Project Managers or technical leads really like the table view that groups issues by Assignee or Milestone.  Tables are information-dense which gives them a good overview of what’s going on in the project, though we also have Kanban to visualize issues as they move through your delivery pipeline.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We handle milestones and labels across multiple repos better than anybody else.  If you create a milestone or label in a Codetree project that spans N repos, we’ll create that milestone or label in all the repos automatically.  Last I checked ZenHub creates it in the main repo but you have to create it in the other repos.  This is most useful for when multiple repos are part of the same product (API repo, front end repo, mobile repo, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If your PM doesn’t like or want tables and doesn’t mind or need to create milestones and labels manually, or wants to stay in the GH UI, then ZenHub is a fine option.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while there’s a bit of snark in that last comment, these are valid points.  The thing that I keep coming back to on ZenHub is the implementation as a Chrome or Firefox plugin.  Perhaps I’m old school but abandoning the native browser on OSX, the iPad and the iPhone seems, well, foolish to me.  And the products do have a different experience level:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CodeTree is a separate site you sign into thru Github which acts as a project management overlay&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ZenHub is inside github entirely; its not a separate thing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up purchasing &lt;strong&gt;CodeTree&lt;/strong&gt; for the whole team and the core issue really was iPad support.  Both products work well enough and both product have some holes.  And while CodeTree’s marketing materials didn’t render well on a phone, the product works quite well on an iPad.  I find that an iPad is an increasingly vital “second screen” for a developer.  Not only does having one force you to make sure that your UI experience doesn’t render poorly on a mobile device but it allows a developer to fork the all too common research tasks to the kitchen table, park, starbucks, etc.  Given the sheer amount of stuff that any developer has to read, iPads are pretty essential these days.  In fact they are essential enough that I specified one as part of the core gear given to our latest hire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sidebar: Knowing Kareem&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So was this purely about the feature set or did my knowing one of the founders affect things?  I’d love to say it was purely objective but I’m sure that knowing Kareem was part of CodeTree was a factor.  Its always a pleasure to reconnect with an old friend and this was no different.  Still the overwhelming factor was browser support. I don’t always carry a laptop but I do always have an iPad these days.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gluten Free Fettuccine Alfredo That is Actually Good</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I don’t write much about cooking here - I save recipes for my &lt;a href=&quot;http://fuzzygroup.github.io/recipes/&quot;&gt;recipe blog&lt;/a&gt; - but I’m particularly proud of this one - A Gluten Free Fettuccine Alfredo that is actually good.  My wife ate it and my sons inhaled it.  No one complained about the gluten free nature.  My wife suffers from celiac disease and really hasn’t had pasta in the past 5 years now.  Yes there have been a few rice noodles when I made Pad Thai from scratch but pasta in the luxurious italian sense?  Nope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran across a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cookscountry.com/recipes/8991-fettuccine-with-butter-and-cheese?incode=MKSKZ00L0&amp;amp;ref=search_results_1&quot;&gt;Fettuccine recipe in Cooks Country&lt;/a&gt; recently and thought “With the right noodle, my wife would adore that” and I came up with this.  Quantities have been adjusted to fit the noodles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-recipe&quot;&gt;The Recipe&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The noodle I chose was&lt;a href=&quot;https://jovialfoods.com/product/egg-tagliatelle-gluten-free-brown-rice-pasta/&quot;&gt; Jovial’s Tagliatelle&lt;/a&gt; and it is excellent.  There’s none of the grittiness / bitterness you all too often find in gluten free foods.  I suspect the reason it is so good is that it is an egg noodle and the lack of ingredients / extenders - Brown Rice Flour, Eggs.  That’s it.  Highly, highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final note – when I made this I didn’t cheap out and get low end cheese and butter.  Since these were the primary ingredients beyond the noodles, I sprung for the good stuff.  And it made a huge difference much to my surprise.  I used Kerry Gold butter and it was delightful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ingredients&quot;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;9 oz tagliatelle&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Salt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4 oz parmigiano-reggiano (2 cups, grated)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5 tbsp butter cut into 5 or more pieces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;steps&quot;&gt;Steps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bring 3 quarts of water to a boil (that’s 12 cups) and add pasta and 1 tbsp salt to it once boiling.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cook for 11 minutes and then save 3/4 cup of the water in a measuring cup for the next stage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drain pasta in colander and add back to pan.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn heat to low and add water, butter and cheese and toss vigorously with tongs for 1 minute.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn off heat and cover for 1 minute.  Add salt to taste and serve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
