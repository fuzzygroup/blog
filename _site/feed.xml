        <title>AWS, Ansible and Boto or Virtualization IS the Answer</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Historically I haven’t been a fan of virtualization whether its Docker, Vagrant or something else.  This whole let’s run a computer inside a computer trend, well, it feels lazy.  It feels like we have an excess of performance so let’s virtualize!  Today, however, I think I may have turned a corner and started to become a fan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation in question was using Ansible to dynamically create EC2 instances.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nickjanetakis.com/&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/a&gt; and I have been hard at this for the past several days and we’re nearing the end – we can just about &lt;em&gt;taste&lt;/em&gt; it.  Well, we could taste it and then yesterday we hit this crap:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;TASK [ec2_create_appdata_proxy : create_instance] ******************************
fatal: [54.244.41.180]: FAILED! =&amp;gt; {&quot;changed&quot;: false, &quot;failed&quot;: true, &quot;msg&quot;: &quot;boto required for this module&quot;}
fatal: [54.218.52.37]: FAILED! =&amp;gt; {&quot;changed&quot;: false, &quot;failed&quot;: true, &quot;msg&quot;: &quot;boto required for this module&quot;}
	to retry, use: --limit @/Users/sjohnson/Dropbox/appdatallc/ansible/playbook_appdata_proxy_create_instances.retry
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a brand new MacBook Pro&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;clean OS install of whatever damn name comes after Capitan - Yosemite maybe?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;fresh installs of everything&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;all components installed thru Ansible itself via my MacBook Pro configuration script&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And no matter what we did, neither of us could come up with a way around this including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;all kinds of sudo manipulations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;installing python’s equivalent to rvm – mkvirtual&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I don’t know Nick’s age or industry experience, he’s a Docker expert, a Udemy star and smart.  My suspicion is that between the two of us we have an aggregate of 40 + industry years.  At least on the Ruby side alone we probably have close to 2 decades of experience.  And yet neither of us could get past an &lt;em&gt;install issue&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Boto was present&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Boto worked via the command line&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Python was present (Boto is a python thing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I tend to have boxes that run for years and cruft does accumulate.  But this wasn’t that circumstance by any means.  This was a box that is so new that it is glorious to use.  And, even so, I’m hitting this crap.  So I know that cruft isn’t the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick and I walked away from a morning of pair programming fairly pissed to be honest.  I took the position of “Well, let’s provision an instance on AWS and do all our Ansible execution from there.”  Nick took the position of “Let’s try using Vagrant as a way to run Ansible locally and create the EC2 resources we need” – and Nick was &lt;strong&gt;right&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-vagrant-file&quot;&gt;The Vagrant File&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the Vagrant file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION = '2'

$provision = &amp;lt;&amp;lt;SCRIPT
sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common
sudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:chris-lea/python-boto
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ansible python-boto python-apt curl git unzip
curl &quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/awscli-bundle.zip&quot; -o &quot;awscli-bundle.zip&quot;
unzip awscli-bundle.zip
yes | sudo ./awscli-bundle/install -i /usr/local/aws -b /usr/local/bin/aws
sudo rm -rf awscli*
SCRIPT

Vagrant.configure(VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION) do |config|
  config.vm.box = 'ubuntu/trusty64'
  config.ssh.insert_key = false

  config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |vm|
    vm.name = 'appdataansible'
    vm.memory = 512
    vm.cpus = 1
    vm.customize ['modifyvm', :id, '--natdnshostresolver1', 'on']
    vm.customize ['modifyvm', :id, '--ioapic', 'on']
  end

  config.vm.define :appdataansible
  config.vm.hostname = 'appdataansible'

  # When re-creating VMs, run ssh-keygen -R 192.168.88.2 to fix connect issues.
  config.vm.network :private_network, ip: '192.168.88.2'

  config.vm.provision 'shell', inline: $provision
  config.vm.provision 'file', source: '~/.aws', destination: '~/.aws'
  
  # TODO: Copy in your pem file for appdata (I didn't know the file name)
  config.vm.provision 'file', source: '/Users/sjohnson/.ssh/appdata_aws.pem', destination: '~/.ssh/appdata_aws.pem'
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I did was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;create a text file called Vagrantfile in my ansible root directory (where all my playbooks reside)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ran the command: &lt;strong&gt;vagrant up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This started the virtual machine and it loaded in all my AWS credentials from ~/.aws/credentials.  Once this was running I had an Ubuntu 14.04 distro running locally i.e. “trusty” and I could use it to execute my playbooks as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ansible-playbook  -i inventories/dummy playbook_appdata_proxy_create_elb.yml -vvv
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the exact syntax I would have used locally.  Even -vvv for extended output is fully available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commands I used successfully within vagrant:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ssh -i ~/.ssh/appdata_aws.pem ubuntu@ec2-54-149-81-245.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com (for logging directly into a created instance)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;aws ec2  describe-instances&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;grep PublicDnsName (for grabbing the DNS names from created instances)&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/tbody&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commands I used to get vagrant going:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;vagrant up (to build it)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;vagrant halt (when I needed to stop it)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;vagrant ssh (to get into it)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cd /vagrant (to get into my locally mounted filesystem within vagrant)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;End to end we spent less than 2 hours to get:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;vagrant running&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a considerable amount of Ansible development done&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;something actually working&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given how hard it can be at times to deal with virtual environments like rvm or its python equivalent and to deal with software troubleshooting this whole process really makes me wonder about whether I should be using Vagrant for other issues.  &lt;strong&gt;Recommended&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Debugging Christmas Lights</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In any family, over time, you specialize in your roles.  This is similar to a work environment where one person gets good at an aspect of the code base and then that person gets tasked with it on a regular basis.  In an ideal world everyone would always be 100% capable at all aspects of the code but we all know that’s generally not the case.  In our family, Dad (me) puts up the Christmas lights.  Part of it is that I don’t mind heights terribly, not the same as saying I like them but you get it but the other part of it is that &lt;em&gt;debugging crap that doesn’t work&lt;/em&gt; is really my very job definition.  And, a few days ago I wanted this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/debugging_xmas_lights.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;debugging_xmas_lights.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but after 10 minutes or so I got this instead:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/debugging_xmas_lights2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;debugging_xmas_lights2.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while I was initially reminded of the Bob Rivers / Twisted Christmas album - “I plug in one light and THEY ALL #$#(&lt;em&gt;$&lt;/em&gt;#) go OUT”, that wasn’t this.  Everything worked perfectly – until it all stopped.  Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very essence of debugging is the quest for understanding and your key tool is &lt;em&gt;persistence&lt;/em&gt;.  I’ve worked with a lot of smart people in my life, many of them dramatically smarter than I am but I haven’t worked with many people who are as persistent.  Whether you are debugging software, hardware or even christmas lights, &lt;em&gt;persistence&lt;/em&gt; is what you want.  If you just think of yourself as a dog with a bone, that’s the right image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok then.  The first step was to get out the tools.  Happily I recently bought a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019EJXUJU/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;non-contact AC voltage tester from Amazon&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/non_contact_tester.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;debugging_xmas_lights2.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this does is essentially &lt;em&gt;sniff&lt;/em&gt; electricity.  I’m not enough of a hardware guy to really understand it but I tried it and it works!  Given that I was doing this on a rainy day, not having to manipulate two test leads or a digital volt ohm meter was a huge, huge win.  This little gadget is actually sensitive enough that you can touch it to the end of a lightning cable and it will detect the voltage there so, apparently, it does both DC and AC.  Oh and did I mention it has an LED pen light built into it?  This thing rocks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever you have something, related to electricity, that happens after a period of latency, the natural suspect is somehow thermal or load related.  But here was the aggregate load:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 power strip&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4 strings of relatively low voltage lights&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01JBTO16E/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;Christmas Laser Projector&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of the strings and the projector were all plugged into a contractor grade, 20 amp, thick as hell extension cord coming from a GFCI outlet.  Call this one Big Green.  The remaining two strings were plugged into a separate contractor grade cord but one that was only 15 amp.  And call this Little Orange.  Both of these have served me thru tree house building, home remodeling, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t sufficient load to trip a breaker.  I grew up doing AC wiring stuff so I have no issues stating that as a fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if we think of this in terms of debugging here are the different components at hand:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;power strip&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;light string 1&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;light string 2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;light string 3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;light string 4&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;extension cord 1 - Big Green&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;extension cord 2 - Little Orange&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;GFCI outlet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any one of these, or any combination of these, could be leading to this problem.  And since it only happened after 10 minutes, I knew that at a worst case I was looking at N * 10 minutes in terms of potential maximum time that I’d be trouble shooting this where N was the number of components, 8.  So this was potentially at least a 90 minute plus exercise.  Given that the amount of time involved was now known to be non trivial, it was time to start by eliminating things outright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: My worst case estimate was actually incorrect.  If the problem was combinatorial in nature like string 1 interacting with string 3 and causing the outage, well, I’m glad I didn’t realize this – its a lot more options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first task was to remove the power strip.  My wife had wanted to add more lasers to the mix so that was there to support the end goal – but we don’t have them yet so it was a case of over-engineering.  So, remove powerstrip, rejigger wires, try again.  &lt;strong&gt;10 minute and darkness!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next step was to look at this in terms of overall complexity.  The most complex component is generally the one most likely to fail.  That meant that I should pull the laser projector from the mix.  Even though it was brand, stinking new, it is definitely more complex than christmas lights so out it goes.  And, once again, &lt;strong&gt;10 minute and darkness!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lights are only a year old but they are very poorly made.  Even though they are a name brand, Sylvania, they seem to epitomize the term &lt;em&gt;shite quality&lt;/em&gt;.  Some of the time just screwing a bulb in blows out the bulb due to poor socket quality.  But my wife loves the visual so the chances of my being able to route these strands of lights to /dev/null approximates zero.  Given that I have issues with the light quality, the next step is to alternately remove each string of lights in turn:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 minute and darkness!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 minute and darkness!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 minute and darkness!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 minute and darkness!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grumble&lt;/em&gt;.  Ok then so what’s left.  At this point we’re down to two extensions cords.  Little Orange isn’t as robust as big green so let’s take that out of the loop - &lt;strong&gt;10 minute and darkness!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hm… The message seems clear – we’re down to Big Green so let’s un plug it and substitute another one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 minute and LIGHT!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 more minute and still LIGHT!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 more minute and still LIGHT!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we’re good now but what went wrong?  To some extent if you debug something and you don’t actually understand the failure cause at the end then you may have won the battle but you have perhaps lost the war as the real goal should always be understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I look a more detailed look at my Big Green extension cord I saw this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/big_green_big_culprit.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;big_green_big_culprit.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently I’ve fixed this extension cord in the past – and then it all made sense.  If you remember I have this all going into a GFCI outlet and I also mentioned that I was doing all this in the rain.  And that was the vital clue.  GFCI stands for Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter and it is a way for an electrical outlet to automatically shut down in dangerous conditions.  Since a GFCI outlet is more expensive than a standard outlet you don’t see them everywhere but they are &lt;strong&gt;required&lt;/strong&gt; for use in commercial bathrooms due to the potential issues with respect to water and electricity.  And if your home builder was any good you likely have them in your home bathrooms for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what seems to have been happening was that moisture was slowly affecting the Big Green extension cord.  After about 10 minutes it caused a GFCI issue which led to a power shut down.  Strangely it seemed to clear itself up almost immediately.  Odder still is that when I checked the extension cord with a circuit tester designed to catch GFCI wiring errors it reported just fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The morals of the story seem to be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t fix your extension cord – just replace it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Debugging is the same when its software, hardware or christmas mights – it call comes down to persistence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anything can be debugged, you just have to take it step by step, bit by bit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merry Christmas!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Code Monkey, Software Engineer, Computer Scientist</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So my buddy Nick mentioned to me that he wrote a blog post titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/are-you-a-computer-scientist-or-a-code-monkey&quot;&gt;Are You a Computer Scientist or a Code Monkey?&lt;/a&gt; and I almost instantly had typed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;jekyll post “Code Monkey, Software Engineer, Computer Scientist”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t actually think that he had finished talking before I had my take on this going.  So:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go read &lt;a href=&quot;https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/are-you-a-computer-scientist-or-a-code-monkey&quot;&gt;Nick’s post&lt;/a&gt;; it is good and I’ll wait.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Come back because my take on it is different.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick looked at this in terms of are you a code monkey or are you a computer scientist.  Personally I think that this is more nuanced than that.  And I don’t think that it is impossible to actually be all of these at once depending on the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: If you haven’t ever listened to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4Wy7gRGgeA&quot;&gt;Jonathan Coulton’s Code Monkey&lt;/a&gt; then you absolutely should.  It is one of the very best, most self aware coding songs anyware.  I have it as the top play in my iTunes collection and it is part of my programming playlist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;science-versus-engineering&quot;&gt;Science Versus Engineering&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a great many people on the Internet who can talk to you about the difference between science and engineering.  To me the fundamental difference is that science is concerned with the &lt;strong&gt;WHY&lt;/strong&gt; and engineering is concerned with the &lt;strong&gt;HOW&lt;/strong&gt;.  As an example consider a hashing algorithm like MD5.  A computer scientist can explain &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; it works but a software engineer just cares about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; it works.  And to draw in our code monkeys, well, a code monkey might not even know that what a hashing algorithm is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;code-monkey&quot;&gt;Code Monkey&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t care what anyone says – we all start as &lt;em&gt;code monkeys&lt;/em&gt;.  I’ve seem trained “computer scientists” come out of university that I would barely give a status of code monkey.  A code monkey is someone who can use a computer to get tasks done in some kind of automated fashion.  This might be&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;software-engineer&quot;&gt;Software Engineer&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;# Computer Scientist
# An Example&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at my recent Poor Man’s Load Balancer post, I think this is a nice illustration of shifting between Computer Scientist and Software Engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>When MySQL Loads Go Wrong - What Do You Do?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This piece is the natural follow on to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://fuzzygroup.github.io/blog/aws/2016/11/26/fear-and-loathing-in-awsville-or-adventures-in-partition-resizing.html&quot;&gt;Adventures in Partition Resizing&lt;/a&gt; epic.  At this point our systems still aren’t fully back up yet and, well, it tastes like ashes.  Like a lot of hard core techies I tend to internalize the state of my system and when its not right, well, things suck for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current state of things is that out of 187 tables that needed to be migrated over, we’re down to the last one – big number 187 and nothing appears to be happening.  All I see at the console is the same thing I’ve seen for over 24 hours:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ubuntu@ip-172-31-43-176:~$ mysql -uappdata -p4PfnGtEGy9JtFF foo_production &amp;lt; /mnt/old2/foo2016_m2s.sql
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it just sits there.  Sigh.  Figuring out the next logical step means that you need to wrap your head around the quirky aspects of the MySQL load architecture.  Happily this isn’t the first time for me so here goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-1---show-full-process-list&quot;&gt;Step 1 - SHOW FULL PROCESS LIST;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have a large table coming in the command line like this, well, MySQL gets seriously weird.  You can’t select a row to see the status.  The best you can do is a SHOW FULL PROCESS LIST which makes the system go nuts.  Seriously - try it sometime.  What you get is an enormous SQL dump showing what’s being loaded and since it scrolls by at like 90 miles per hour, well, that’s not helpful.  Here’s a little trick tho:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pager less;
SHOW FULL PROCESS LIST\G
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this will give you something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;*************************** 1. row ***************************
      Id: 257
    User: appdata
    Host: localhost
      db: foo_production
 Command: Query
    Time: 0
   State: update
    Info: INSERT INTO `foo2016_q1s` VALUES (240213,'2016-03-16 21:14:57','2016-
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that there 927,040 records in this table what this has shown us is that after 36 hours or so we’re only 1/4 of the way thru.  Press ESC and run SHOW FULL PROCESS LIST a few times to make sure that id value keeps changing to get confirmation that the load is continuing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only problem is that what I just wrote above may &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; be reliable – emphasis on the &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt;.  Here’s what I just got when I ran it again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Id: 257
    User: appdata
    Host: localhost
      db: banks_production
 Command: Query
    Time: 0
   State: update
    Info: INSERT INTO `foo2016_q1s` VALUES (406347,'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no way that roughly 200K records went in while I was writing two paragraphs so what we now know is that SHOW FULL PROCESS LIST tells you that the load is proceeding but it may be &lt;strong&gt;utterly useless&lt;/strong&gt; as a monitoring tool.  Deep, Deep Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-2---desc-foo2016m2s&quot;&gt;Step 2 - DESC foo2016_m2s&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next logical step is to check the schema to make sure nothing weird is going on.  This can be done with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;DESC foo2016_m2s;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In MySQL checking the schema tells you nothing about the index structures so you can check those with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;SHOW CREATE TABLE foo2016_m2s;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My guess is that you won’t learn anything from these operations but this is step by step, high value debugging so you check everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-3---options&quot;&gt;Step 3 - Options&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logical next step would be to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;stop the load&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;delete the last record as it might not be complete&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;find the last id (thank heavens that ids are sequential)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;re-dump from the original source table from the last record + 1 forward&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;re-import&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If, Ghu Help Us, we find that stopping the load means that there isn’t any data in the table then the next step would be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Export from the original source in say 100K record chunks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Import the first one and see what happens&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Import the next one and see what happens&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Think carefully if we want to proceed sequentially or move to loading files in parallel; if the issue is bad data somewhere in a load file then parallel is a bad, bad, bad idea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need a long job architecture&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Time Machine Backup Woes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It is a fairly well understood IT truism that you don’t really know how good your backup strategy is &lt;strong&gt;until&lt;/strong&gt; you restore it.  I’m an IT professional and I’ve been one my whole life but, even so, I still got bit badly by backup woes.  About a month ago I took a moderately functioning 2011 Macbook Pro 15” and did a full time machine back up on it.  Then I wiped it and played with Linux distros on it.  The machine did have valuable data on it but I did a full backup on it and I was beyond careful:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the backup disk was labeled&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the backup disk was turned off&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the backup disk was physically unplugged&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that I had valuable data on the disk, I wanted to be absolutely certain that nothing happened to it.  I always knew I’d restore it but I wasn’t sure exactly &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt;.  And then &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; turned out to be today.  Now, since the title includes the words “backup” and “woes” you do know that this isn’t going to end well, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;problem-the-first----200-gigs-free-space&quot;&gt;Problem the First – 200 Gigs Free Space&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first inkling that something had gone very, very wrong came when I did a &lt;strong&gt;df -h&lt;/strong&gt; and realized that my restored computer has roughly 200 gigs of free space.  Normally this box runs between 5 and 20 gigs free.  Clearly there is a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;problem-the-second----all-passwords-have-to-be-re-entered&quot;&gt;Problem the Second – All Passwords Have to be Re-Entered&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was weird – I noticed that sometimes I’d have to re-enter passwords when I know that they worked perfectly before.  I find this odd because it implies that not everything got restored.  This is troubling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;problem-the-third----iphoto-doesnt-work-at-all&quot;&gt;Problem the Third – iPhoto Doesn’t Work At All&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly I found that my copy of iPhoto told me that it wouldn’t work under Capitan.  I don’t know how an older version of iPhoto got left behind when this box was upgraded to capitan but, again, troubling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I simply copied iPhoto from another Capitan box onto a USB stick and dropped it onto this machine and it worked beautifully and, praise Ghu, I have pictures of my kids again.  As I said in the beginning – &lt;strong&gt;valuable data&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;problem-the-fourth----where-are-my-damn-databases&quot;&gt;Problem the Fourth – WHERE ARE MY DAMN DATABASES?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here comes the punch line – the missing data seems to all be my MySQL databases.  A quick google shows that for the query “time machine” “mysql” (indicating that both terms are phrases and both are required) gives some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22mysql%22+%22time+machine%22&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&quot;&gt;227,000 results&lt;/a&gt;.  Clearly I’m not the only one with an issue here.  My guess is that the data I need is actually on the backup disc – somewhere.  I suspect that Time Machine doesn’t restore anything outside of /Users/ and the operating system itself.  And, yes, that’s stupid.  Quite honestly this is likely the last time I’ll ever trust Time Machine.  Sheesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone out there has experience with restoring MySQL databases from Time Machine I’d really appreciate some assistance.  Trying to ferret out their location from the back up disc is mildly impenetrable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion-and-a-recommendation&quot;&gt;Conclusion and a Recommendation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know someone out there is saying “Carbon Copy Cloner”.  Yep.  I know.  And I own a full copy, bought and paid for.  But I honestly thought that Time Machine was good enough for a personal backup.  Apparently, at least for a developer, it is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt;.  Tomorrow I am figuring out where MySQL stores its data on all my other OSX boxes and I’m relocating it to a location inside /Users/sjohnson with a vengeance.&lt;/p&gt;
