        <description>&lt;p&gt;So I recently had an interesting opportunity to write a bunch of code in a fast paced environment.  I was putting in about 40 hours of week albeit around the edges of my full time gig.  I was the sole contributor during this period save for a few view files that essentially amounted to a rounding error in the size of the project.  All code was new and written in a Rails 5 stack.  There also was a separate NLP engine implemented using Rack / Grape but that was relatively small so its omitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I knocked out in that time frame:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
+----------------------+--------+--------+---------+---------+-----+-------+
| Name                 |  Lines |    LOC | Classes | Methods | M/C | LOC/M |
+----------------------+--------+--------+---------+---------+-----+-------+
| Controllers          |   1509 |   1122 |      24 |     125 |   5 |     6 |
| Helpers              |    369 |    309 |       0 |      37 |   0 |     6 |
| Jobs                 |      2 |      2 |       1 |       0 |   0 |     0 |
| Models               |   3813 |   1839 |      28 |     165 |   5 |     9 |
| Mailers              |      4 |      4 |       1 |       0 |   0 |     0 |
| Channels             |     15 |     13 |       3 |       1 |   0 |    11 |
| Javascripts          |    119 |     23 |       0 |       5 |   0 |     2 |
| Libraries            |    251 |    175 |       0 |       1 |   0 |   173 |
| Tasks                |    251 |    175 |       0 |       1 |   0 |   173 |
| Controller specs     |    890 |    632 |       0 |       7 |   0 |    88 |
| Helper specs         |    420 |    133 |       0 |       5 |   0 |    24 |
| Model specs          |    452 |    346 |       0 |       0 |   0 |     0 |
+----------------------+--------+--------+---------+---------+-----+-------+
| Total                |   8095 |   4773 |      57 |     347 |   6 |    11 |
+----------------------+--------+--------+---------+---------+-----+-------+
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: Output is from the rake stats command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was pretty happy with this. The first 3 weeks were pure greenfield development and it was the most glorious coding fun I’ve had in years.  No specs just an MVP product concept and go.  Not bad for nights and weekends, eh?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Welcome to Jekyll!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ll find this post in your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;Tom&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints &#39;Hi, Tom&#39; to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

        <title>Failing At React Native Just By Starting</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;#Failing at React Native Just By Starting
One of the problems of having done development for a long, long time is you get use to certain idiosyncratic practices of your own.  Things that you do for every project because you know that if you don’t you’re going to have issues.  One of mine is that I always, always, always, unfailingly, always create a top level directory in a project called docs and in there I put ANYTHING and EVERYTHING related to the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If its ruby and a gem dumps some anomalous output on startup?  Bam!  It goes in docs.  If its nokogiri and I can’t install it for the 11,000th time and I finally dig up this bit of arcana:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;gem install nokogiri – –with-xml2-include=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.11.sdk/usr/include/libxml2 –use-system-libraries&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bam!  It goes in docs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And those idiosyncratic practices?  Sometimes they kill you…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been messing about with React Native recently and I created a new project, fired it off in the Simulator and got this little gem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;!(http://imgur.com/a/fPhGP)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it has really left me scratching my head.  Google gave me nothing helpful.  Nor did Stack Overflow.  Nor did trying again and again.  Finally I was typing out a description to a buddy and it hit me “Schmuck!  You always do exactly the same thing – DO NOT make a docs directory”.  So I moved the directory and fired off the simulator and:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;!(http://imgur.com/a/RnC4T)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Habits.  Great when they work.  Sometimes they just plain don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
