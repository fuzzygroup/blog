        <title>Managing An Attack of Hives</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/em&gt; I am not a doctor.  I am not a nurse.  I do not even play a doctor or a nurse on the Internet.  But I have been unlucky enough to suffer from poison ivy on N (N rounds up pretty high; it involves the number of fingers on both hands) occasions so I know a lot about suffering through itchiness.  And I’ve had hives myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently watched a dear, dear friend come down with hives out of the clear blue.  One day they were fine and the next day there were “an itchy, splotchy mess”.  Hives are one of those things that generally are an allergic reaction that you never quite understand.  They come over you, your life sucks beyond belief and then they go away.  As another friend would say, “How Rude!”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ultimately figured out a good way to help deal with the itchiness but it took about a day so I thought I’d write down some tips and recommendations.  I know this is not the sort of content I usually produce but it made at least one person’s life better so …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;managing-hives-or-poison-ivy&quot;&gt;Managing Hives or Poison Ivy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some techniques for managing hives or poison ivy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cool water; never hot.  Getting under a hot shower with an itchy condition actually feels good but it is a complete mistake. It seems to reactivate the underlying cause.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Benadryl-Ultratabs-Antihistamine-Allergy-Diphenhydramine/dp/B001F1DV72/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?keywords=benedryl&amp;amp;qid=1556977968&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;sr=8-2-spons&amp;amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;Benedryl&lt;/a&gt;.  If you’re looking for a medicine and don’t mind the associated drowsiness, Benedryl really does help.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Aveeno-Soothing-Treatment-Itchy-Irritated/dp/B000UEAARO/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3GVFYJIK6BNCE&amp;amp;keywords=aveeno+oatmeal+bath&amp;amp;qid=1556977411&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;sprefix=aveeno+ot%2Caps%2C138&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;Colloidal Oatmeal Bath&lt;/a&gt;.  If you have the ability to soak in a tub, a cool tub filled with the Aveeno Oatmeal works well.  Or you can make your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-to-make-your-own-oatmeal-bath-289466&quot;&gt;own&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Benadryl-Relief-Spray-Extra-Strength/dp/B00MHYLOMA/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=FG56ZRO8EATG&amp;amp;keywords=spray+benedryl&amp;amp;qid=1556977467&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;sprefix=spray+bene%2Caps%2C139&amp;amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;smid=ASEVS99O6FS73&quot;&gt;Spray Benadryl&lt;/a&gt;.  This is a topical spray and while it makes you sticky, it provides solid relief.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Gold-Bond-Ultimate-Eczema-Protectant/dp/B00GIHMOGW/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=gold+bond+eczema+ultimate+relief&amp;amp;qid=1556979092&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;sr=8-5&quot;&gt;Gold Bond Ultimate Eczema Relief&lt;/a&gt;.  This is a colloidal oatmeal lotion and it has specific ingredients (since its an eczema solution) to “deal with the itches”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/ZANFEL-Poison-Ivy-Sumac-Wash/dp/B000GCPWUU/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=zanfel&amp;amp;qid=1556977531&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;amp;smid=A188ED3JB77RWM&amp;amp;th=1&quot;&gt;Zanfel&lt;/a&gt;.  I listed this last but it is ABSOLUTELY THE BEST THING EVER for hives or poison ivy.  It is ridiculously expensive ($50 for a tube in downtown Chicago) but it is completely worth it.  Follow the directions exactly and it provides fantastic relief.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the recommendations above, #6, Zanfel, is the best.  You won’t want to spend the money but it really is worth it. #5 also comes very, very highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Getting AWS Costs Under Control</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; AWS is an abbreviation for Amazon Web Services, the Amazon cloud computing platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am presently responsible for a monthly AWS budget that is running about $20,000 per month.  And that is up from about $11,000 per month only eight months ago.  I was recently tasked with bringing that down through &lt;em&gt;reserved instances&lt;/em&gt; and I thought that writing up the learnings from doing a deep dive into reserved instances and AWS Cost Control was worth writing up.  Even though I’ve worked with AWS now since 2008, I found the results of my research pretty damn surprising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should note that when I say “responsible”, I mean that I have technical / implementation responsibility in my role as a Senior Software Engineer. I’m not actually a cost control / accounting person in any way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-reserved-instances&quot;&gt;What are Reserved Instances&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to understand is that Reserved Instances are poorly named, very poorly named.  Reserved instances are nothing more than &lt;em&gt;coupons&lt;/em&gt; for the use of an instance of the type of the coupon.  You actually aren’t reserving a specific instance but instead saying to Amazon “Ok I’ll buy this much of instance type X”.  And it is important to understand that reserved instances aren’t a simple volume discount.  They are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Massively complex and confusing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Expensive, requiring an up front payment to get the maximum discount&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Available in multiple flavors such as convertible and non convertible&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Complex enough that after researching them in depth you will want to drink and drink heavily&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Such a big deal that there actually is a secondary market where you can resell and purchase reserved instances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I looked into how much reserved instances could save us, I generally found between a 15% to 20% savings with our current approach to things.  Given our current spending rate, that could easily amount to nearly $40,000 per year.   And while that’s nothing to sneer at, my research into reserved instances told me to keep digging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most interesting thing about reserved instances with respect  to AWS cost control is that universally the recommendation I found was this: &lt;em&gt;Don’t start with reserved instances&lt;/em&gt;.  Even though reserved instances directly reduce your costs, you should never start with reserved instances.  And that brings us to the next section, AWS Cost Control Strategy.
￼
## AWS Cost Control Strategy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a considerable amount of research, I came up with the following approach for reducing AWS costs. Please note that where I say “we”, you should substitute your own organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We need to designate someone as the person responsible for managing / monitoring AWS costs.  Right now, for example, we have a quarter of a million dollar budgetary line item that &lt;em&gt;no one&lt;/em&gt; is responsible for.  This isn’t a technical problem; this is an accounting problem.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We need to correctly tag all instances by name, by product family, by application and more so that there is the metadata to properly examine and drill into costs using the AWS or third party accounting tools.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We need to implement a lights on / lights off strategy where you turn off resources when they aren’t in use.  As an example, our staging and training environments clusters of machines only need to be available some of the time (staging needs to be available Mon - Friday, 9 to 6 EST; training needs to be available only when specifically scheduled).  Right now all those environments are powered up and available 24x7x365.  Admittedly these aren’t as many boxes as our production environment but if you don’t have something turned on, you’re not paying for it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We need to implement a Right Sizing strategy where we dig into machine utilization and figure out if we’re actually using the correctly sized instances or if we are over spending by using machines that are too large.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We should only implement reserved instances when &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the above steps are implemented.  Otherwise you are over buying capacity that you likely don’t need.  Also it is not widely understood that you can buy reserved instances not only for your EC2 boxes but also for your RDS boxes; keep that firmly in mind when you plan your reserved instance purchases.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finally we need to realize that AWS Cost Management is a task you need to do regularly whether that is monthly, quarterly or annually.  It needs to be not only someone’s actual job (or portion of their job) but as an activity, it needs to be done consistently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tools-and-recommended-reading&quot;&gt;Tools and Recommended Reading&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some tools to investigate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/instance-scheduler/&quot;&gt;AWS Instance Scheduler&lt;/a&gt; - This is a code based tool to configure turn on / turn off of your cloud instances&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkmycloud.com&quot;&gt;Park My Cloud&lt;/a&gt; - This is a tool which can turn on / off your cloud instances automatically with an easy user interface&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudhealthtech.com&quot;&gt;CloudHealth&lt;/a&gt; - this is an AWS management and analytics tool with specific features for reserved instance analysis&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudability.com&quot;&gt;CloudAbility&lt;/a&gt; - this is an AWS management and analytics tool with specific features for reserved instance analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CloudAbility and CloudHealth tools are seriously pricey, they are generally priced as a percentage of your AWS bill, but they have outstanding analytics features and the ability  to analyze your reserved instance needs more powerfully than the built in AWS tools for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the better research materials to investigate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jhKM1rgpEw&quot;&gt;AWS Cost Optimization Levers, Tools and Strategies&lt;/a&gt;.  This is an excellent video from the AWS Australia branch.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5rlqaC6uNs&quot;&gt;Saving at Scale with Reserved Instances by Cloudability&lt;/a&gt;.  This is also excellent and it illustrates two key points - a) that reserved instances can actually increase your bill and b) that you really need to have someone responsible for AWS cost control on an ongoing basis&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://get.cloudability.com/rs/064-CAC-529/images/the-complete-guide-to-saving-with-aws-reserved-instances-ebook.pdf&quot;&gt;Reserved Instance Ebook&lt;/a&gt;.  A great read.&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>New Job Hound Feature - Create Cover Letters More Easily</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When you are a product creator, there is something wonderful about building a product that people are really using and implementing a new feature that you &lt;strong&gt;know&lt;/strong&gt; will make their lives easier.  I am very, very please to announce the new Job Hound feature Cover Letters More Easily.  Yes I know that’s an absolutely crap name but it does describe what this does.  Let me walk you through how this works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of Job Hound is an underlying database of the jobs you apply for and how successful you are with them.  Success is measured by your interactions with the job and Job Hound understands that the type of interaction that you have matters.  Every job has a number of status fields like “got_hr_screen” or “passed_technical_interview”.  As each job gains additional status fields, the underlying “score” associated with how successful you are &lt;em&gt;for this job&lt;/em&gt; grows.  And that is how Job Hound can do things like generate a report of cover letters organized by most successful to least successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s walk through the cover letter creation process as it has been and then let’s walk through it with the new features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;before&quot;&gt;Before&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to create a cover letter, you start at your list of Jobs to Apply For:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jobhound.io/assets/cover_letter_all_jobs.png&quot; alt=&quot;cover_letter_all_jobs.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say that you want to apply for the Eezy job so you click on it giving you the details of the job:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The obvious next step is to click on the Add Cover Letter button:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jobhound.io/assets/cover_letter_eezy.png&quot; alt=&quot;https://jobhound.io/assets/cover_letter_eezy.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clicking that Add Cover Letter button takes you into the Cover Letter writer where you can see the job description but you start with a totally blank screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jobhound.io/assets/cover_letter_blank.png&quot; alt=&quot;https://jobhound.io/assets/cover_letter_blank.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: The Job Description above is something that Job Hound always tries to provide so that you can write your cover letter to respond to the requirements of the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing anything from a blank state is always harder than starting from a template so let’s see how this has been improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;with-the-new-feature&quot;&gt;With the New Feature&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the new feature you can start creating your cover letter for a job you want to apply for by going to the Successful Cover Letter report (click Report in the menu bar):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jobhound.io/assets/cover_letter_all_reports.png&quot; alt=&quot;https://jobhound.io/assets/cover_letter_all_reports.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Select the Successful Cover Letters report from the links and you’ll see the report of all your cover letters organized from most successful to least successful.  In this case we want to use the Wedding Wire cover letter as a template for the job we want to apply to – Eezy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jobhound.io/assets/cover_letter_select_from_report.png&quot; alt=&quot;https://jobhound.io/assets/cover_letter_select_from_report.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just select the Eezy job from the drop down list (yes I realize now that I didn’t show Eezy in the drop down; apologies; it is there) and click the Create Cover Letter from this button.  That will take you to the Cover Letter Writer with the selected template loaded in.  You can now adjust the the cover letter for your new job.  You’ll notice an alert message at the top that reminds you to make adjustments like the company name and job title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jobhound.io/assets/cover_letter_create_from_template.png&quot; alt=&quot;https://jobhound.io/assets/cover_letter_create_from_template.pngg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can easily start from your list of cover letters, choose the one that works best for the job you want to apply to and instantly create a new cover letter from it.  Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Anatomy of an Accidental Product Launch with Metrics - Day 1</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m a software engineer and I am decidedly &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; a marketing guy (I play one on the Internet from time to time but I really just write code).  I recently launched a side project, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jobhound.io&quot;&gt;Job Hound&lt;/a&gt;, that had an unexpectedly successful first day and I thought documenting it might help someone out there (and certainly help me; that’s usually why I blog anything; it helps me understand things).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-job-hound&quot;&gt;What is Job Hound?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Job Hound is a tool that I wrote recently as a way to “make getting a tech job suck less”.  I recently went out to get a full time gig and I found the process &lt;a href=&quot;http://fuzzyblog.io/blog/jobhound/2018/04/24/ten-things-i-learned-from-a-job-hunt-for-a-senior-engineering-role.html&quot;&gt;just so plain awful&lt;/a&gt; so I wrote software as a way to put myself in control of it.  After finding it incredibly useful for my own needs, and then showing it a few friends to positive feedback, I figured that I’d throw it on a cheap Digital Ocean box and see what happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;timing-for-metrics&quot;&gt;Timing for Metrics&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m writing this after the first 16 hours the product was live.  All marketing activities were done around 8 am EST.  There’s a bit in the Metrics section that gives the numbers after a full 24 hours but this was initially written at the 16 hour mark and then published a few days later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;my-launch-plan&quot;&gt;My Launch “Plan”&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week an article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://work.qz.com/1254663/job-interviews-for-programmers-now-often-come-with-days-of-unpaid-homework/&quot;&gt;Quartz talking about the rise in homework for job seekers&lt;/a&gt; took off on &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16874015&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; with 989 comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here was my launch plan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:  You should document your story on your struggle to find a job and then post it on Hacker News&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: Ok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly there wasn’t more to it than that.  This isn’t a humblebrag by any means.  Someone I respect suggested it and, well, that is how it started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had about 500 words of a very crufty blog post in draft form right in my coding editor so I polished that up from 5 am to 7 am and that became my &lt;a href=&quot;http://fuzzyblog.io/blog/jobhound/2018/04/24/ten-things-i-learned-from-a-job-hunt-for-a-senior-engineering-role.html&quot;&gt;Ten Things I Learned from a Job Hunt for a Senior Engineering Role&lt;/a&gt; blog post.  I also submitted it to &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16912546#16913834&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; where over the course of the next 16 hours, it got 638 comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should point out that this is the first thing I’ve ever submitted to Hacker News that has gotten &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; traction at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did tweet my blog post on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twiiter.com/fuzzygroup/&quot;&gt;my personal twitter&lt;/a&gt; and I also made a Job Hound specific tweet and then pinned the Job Hound tweet so it stayed at the top of my twitter feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I honestly never even thought to put my blog post on Facebook.  I did that 24 hours later so I don’t have any metrics on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My final launch action, one I had no hope for at all, was that I also tossed Job Hound up on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/posts/job-hound&quot;&gt;Product Hunt&lt;/a&gt; where it got 56 up votes during roughly the same period (it may have been on Product Hunt 1 day longer; the whole day is kind of a blur right now).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;fine-tuning&quot;&gt;Fine Tuning&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did relatively little tuning of the content.  My buddy Nick suggested that I emphasize the free nature of Job Hound in the blog post and that I add the Product Hunt link into the blog post.  Both of these were good ideas and done around 2 pm EST.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-metrics&quot;&gt;The Metrics&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since roughly 8 am this morning (sixteen hours so far), Job Hound has had:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;204 user accounts created (email / password)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;98 jobs added&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An average of 0.48 jobs per user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a full 24 hours, the numbers were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;236 user accounts created (email / password)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;119 jobs added&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An average of 0.50 jobs per user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of social media metrics, I started the day with 163 twitter followers and I ended it a full 24 hours later with 187.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are these numbers good?  I think that absolutely depends on your perspective.  For a side project that I publicly launched with absolutely zero planning – I’m absolutely delighted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Followup after 4 days&lt;/strong&gt;: The numbers have continued to steadily grow and I’ve gotten quite a few emails, linked in messages, tweets and other feedback that all indicates to me that I have hit on something.  My plan is that keep working Job Hound as a side project and just making it better and better.  Maybe something comes of this; maybe not but helping people get jobs is a &lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt; thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;other&quot;&gt;Other&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received a number of emails and messages via LinkedIn and I tried to respond to everyone on the same day.  I’ve always found that talking to users is the best damn marketing you can do.  This is the root of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jobhound.io/pages/thank_you&quot;&gt;Job Hound Thank You&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re probably wondering “what about the web traffic?”  I’m sorry to say that my Google Analytics skills just aren’t all that good so I haven’t been able to dig into them with any success as of yet.  I’m sure the data is there but I’m too brain dead to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion---content-does-work&quot;&gt;Conclusion - Content Does Work&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think my overall conclusions from all this are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creating content on the Internet as a marketing tool really does work but the content has to have value of its own.  You can’t simply shill your product; embed it in something that is interesting all on its own.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Telling a personal story works.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lucky is better than smart.  I was extremely lucky in getting coverage from Hacker News.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Timing matters.  I was lucky to be able to ride a wave of hiring interest from the Quartz article.  This didn’t occur to me and it took the pushing of a good friend for me to put this out.  Thanks Nick.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Ten Things I Learned from a Job Hunt for a Senior Engineering Role</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently went on a search for a new full time gig and I learned that today’s job search is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; what it used to be.  Here’s the quick summary of what I learned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The job search takes much, much longer than it used to.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No one believes that anyone can actually code.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coding Tests Can Trip Up Even Good Engineers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Extensive homework is now normal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Every company’s “process” is different&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Outsourced hiring “services” are very much in vogue&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Companies Really Want to Know Your Salary; Don’t tell Them&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interviews Matter Much, Much More to You Than to the Company&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Age discrimination really exists.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’ll never really know why you weren’t hired.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of full disclosure, at the end of this article, I’m going to pitch you on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jobhound.io&quot;&gt;new tool&lt;/a&gt; I built for managing your personal job hunt, but don’t worry, it’s &lt;strong&gt;free&lt;/strong&gt; to use.  I found the job hunt process so &lt;strong&gt;absolutely distasteful&lt;/strong&gt; that the only way I could get through it was to actually create some software based on what I learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;who-am-i&quot;&gt;Who Am I?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s just a bit about myself so you can understand my job search.  I’m a senior software guy who’s still writing code after all these years.  My platform is generally Ruby / Rails and my &lt;a href=&quot;http://fuzzyblog.io/blog/resume.html&quot;&gt;resume&lt;/a&gt; is here in case you care.  I’ve been a consultant for the last few years and I wanted to get back to a full time gig in a senior engineering role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the stats from my job search:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Total Jobs Applied For: &lt;strong&gt;82&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Total Jobs Where You Got an HR Interview	&lt;strong&gt;25&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Total Jobs Where You Got a Technical Interview:	&lt;strong&gt;15&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Total Jobs Where You Got an Onsite Interview: &lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Total Job Offers: &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;number-1-it-takes-longer-than-ever-to-get-hired&quot;&gt;Number 1: It Takes Longer than Ever to Get Hired&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been in high tech a long time and other than the few really bad times, the general rule in high tech hiring has been “fill an engineering slot as fast as possible”.  The industry may talk a good game about culture fit but other than a few firms, it always has been about quickly putting bodies in seats.  That is absolutely no longer the case.  HR departments now seem to be focused on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Initially getting a large number of candidates to review as the first step (and nothing, even when you seem to be a perfect requirement match, happens until they get that large group of candidates).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Marching the entire group of candidates, step by step, through their entire process.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Putting as many barriers in place before hiring anyone.  I discuss this more below under process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just so you’re aware, the HR departments will not own up to the process taking longer than ever.  They will spin you a song and a dance about how quickly things are going to progress and it just isn’t true.  My two observations in this area are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Companies today, despite what they might say, are pickier about candidates than ever&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Companies are less willing to hire than I’ve ever seen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One helpful thing I did during my job hunt was track everything so I actually had dates all along.  Here’s an example of what I commonly saw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2/5 was my initial application to Company W&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3/1 was when I completed my homework project&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3/2 was when I got scheduled for an onsite interview&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3/23 was when I found out that I didn’t get it (two weeks after my onsite)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s almost two months start to finish!  And today that job remains on the company’s web site – they still haven’t hired anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;number-2-no-one-believes-anyone-can-actually-code&quot;&gt;Number 2: No One Believes Anyone Can Actually Code&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general thing that I saw from everyone that I talked to is that no one actually believes that anyone can code.  At every stage in the interview process, you’re going to need to &lt;strong&gt;prove&lt;/strong&gt; that your resume isn’t a lie and that you can actually do what you say you can.  I find this ludicrous because it is like interviewing an attorney and then saying to him “Please prove that you can cite a Supreme Court precedent”.  When did an entire industry of people get pre-judged as lying?   Don’t we exist in a country where the default assumption is innocence not guilt?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;number-3-coding-tests-can-trip-up-even-good-engineers&quot;&gt;Number 3: Coding Tests Can Trip Up Even Good Engineers&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An extremely common thing that you’re going to find as part of a job search are coding tests and I’d urge you NOT to take them lightly.  These coding tests tend to bear &lt;strong&gt;no resemblance&lt;/strong&gt; to anything you’ll do in the work place and even good engineers can get tripped up by them.  I found that part way through my job search I had to buckle down, hit the books and start practicing on different coding tests to get my scores up.  Once upon a time I would have said that any engineer should be able to pass a coding test but that’s just not true.  The longer you are in industry, I would argue the less likely you may be to pass a coding test.  I suspect I could have done much better on a coding test fresh out of college when my “test taking skills” were actually something I used.  Now?  The last test I passed was for a driver’s license.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; You should note that since most tests come from an outsourced service like Codility, you can google for practice questions, sample exams and more.  And I’d strongly encourage you to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t underestimate coding tests at all.  I did and it was to my disadvantage.  You really, really need to practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;number-4-extensive-homework-is-now-normal&quot;&gt;Number 4: Extensive Homework is Now Normal&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a hiring manager, I’ve given homework assignments to weed out candidates from the pack but I always kept it reasonable, just a few hours in length.  I’ve now regularly seen homework assignments ranging from 8 hours to “spend a week on this and really show us what you can do”.  Over on &lt;a href=&quot;https://work.qz.com/1254663/job-interviews-for-programmers-now-often-come-with-days-of-unpaid-homework/&quot;&gt;QZ&lt;/a&gt; there is an excellent article about this along with &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16874015&quot;&gt;984 comments on Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;.  And yes that’s a huge amount of comments on any one topic since the current amount of comments on the top 30 items on Hacker News is &lt;strong&gt;53&lt;/strong&gt; comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should be aware that your coding submission will be judged all kinds of ways, often unfairly.  For one application I built, I was told “you didn’t allow for proper performance given a 500x increase in data”. This came after being specifically told “use no technologies other than the database itself” (it was a search application). And what good engineer allows for an arbitrary 500x increase?  That is massive, unnecessary over engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; One thing that I did do to stand out from the crowd for almost all my homework assignments was to record a screencast talking through my work and illustrating what I thought were the best points.  I had several interviewers tell me that “thank you; I’ve never seen that before”.  This gets the interviewer past any issues with getting code installed / setup, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should comment that even though I don’t like the trend towards homework, I vastly prefer it to coding tests.  You shouldn’t think, however, that just because you passed the homework assignment, you won’t face a whiteboard challenge - every place I did a home assignment for, I also got a whiteboard challenge, sometimes multiple ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;number-5-every-companys-process-is-different&quot;&gt;Number 5: Every Company’s Process Is Different&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It used to be that getting a coding job boiled down to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Send in resume&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;HR Screen&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Technical Interview&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Team Interview&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a pretty standard process and I saw (and hired) a lot of people with this approach.  Apparently though times change and now the “process” is all over the map.  One of the most useful things I learned to ask companies early on was “Please explain your hiring process to me” and then I wrote it down for each company.  This let me know “for company X, the process is”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;HR Screen&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coding Test&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coding Project&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Technical Interview&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pair Programming&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Technical Interview with the Team&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Onsite Interview&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you’re going to find is that while there are common elements (currently homework) in the hiring process, everyone’s process is different.  If you know what a company cares about then you can start to get ready before it happens.  For example, if you know in advance that you have a coding test in front of you, this lets you know that you may need to study.  If an HR person says to me “Oh and we administer a coding test” then my first response is “I’ve taken a bunch of those, which one do you use?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;number-6-outsourced-hiring-assessment-services-are-very-much-in-vogue&quot;&gt;Number 6: Outsourced Hiring Assessment Services Are Very Much in Vogue&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that really surprised me was how many companies rely on outsourced hiring services.  I saw this all over the place from companies that sent me a link to a coding test, often &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codility.com/&quot;&gt;Codility&lt;/a&gt;, to “personality assessment” tools, often &lt;a href=&quot;www.predictiveindex.com&quot;&gt;Predictive Index&lt;/a&gt;.  I suppose this is the natural evolution of SAAS companies into the hiring space.  When I was recruiting, in years past, my HR department always strongly warned me against administering coding tests on the grounds of legal issues / fairness.  Now that these are outsourced, I suspect that HR departments aren’t concerned at all about legal issues since they come from a vendor not themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that you’ll find is that these outsourced assessment services are being stuck into the hiring process at &lt;strong&gt;ANY&lt;/strong&gt; point in the process.  I’ve seen things ranging from HR screen to initial technical interview to coding test to send in a resume and get a personality test fired back at you before you ever talk to a human being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;number-7-companies-really-want-to-know-your-salary-dont-tell-them&quot;&gt;Number 7: Companies Really Want to Know Your Salary; Don’t tell Them&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I started my job search, I was lucky enough to read Josh Doody’s fabulous book &lt;a href=&quot;https://fearlesssalarynegotiation.com/&quot;&gt;Fearless Salary Negotiation&lt;/a&gt; and the best thing I got from it was “Never disclose your current salary or expectations”.  I never disclosed it but I found HR people absolutely relentless on this point.  I finally said to one California company “You do realize that legally you can’t ask me that” and they shamelessly replied “Yes I can; you aren’t in California”.  And you’ll find that there are web forms which require you to fill it in (I always put in a minimal, crazy number like 1234).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh and if you haven’t read Josh’s book then I strongly encourage you to do so.  It is a short but fantastic read.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Fearless-Salary-Negotiation-step-step/dp/0692568689/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1524566767&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=fearless+salary+negotiation&quot;&gt;Here’s an Amazon link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;number-8-interviews-matter-much-much-more-to-you-than-to-the-company&quot;&gt;Number 8: Interviews Matter Much, Much More to You Than to the Company&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately it is entirely true that any given interview matters far more &lt;strong&gt;to you&lt;/strong&gt; than it does &lt;strong&gt;to the company&lt;/strong&gt; that is interviewing you.  Any candidate has only a relatively small number of jobs they can even apply for where as the company has all of the Internet applying (this is particularly true if the company is any good).  I couldn’t even count how many interviews companies missed, were late on, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;number-9-age-discrimination-is-real&quot;&gt;Number 9: Age Discrimination is Real&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;: I recently turned 50 and I’m still a hands on engineer who writes code just about every single day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One very surprising thing to me was just how much I discovered that age discrimination in high tech hiring is real.  There were all too many times when jobs that I was an absolute perfect match for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I never got an interview at all&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I was mysteriously ghosted midway though the process&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I got all the way to the end, nailed everything perfectly and then never found out why I didn’t get it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of those things that you never can prove and no one will ever own up to I do think that is very, very real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;number-10-youll-never-really-know-why-you-werent-hired&quot;&gt;Number 10: You’ll Never Really Know Why You Weren’t Hired&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that there are lots of actually good reasons why companies don’t want to tell you why you weren’t hired but this remains my single biggest issue with today’s job hunt.  I can understand that you can’t tell everyone why they didn’t get hired but when you get to the end point and pass all these hurdles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;HR Screen&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coding Test&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coding Project&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Technical Interview&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pair Programming&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Technical Interview with the Team&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Onsite Interview&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would think that more information than “We all really liked you but we went in a different direction” could be said.  I saw this repeatedly on jobs that I got all the way to the end point on.  How is a candidate ever supposed to improve themselves when the company will not tell you why you didn’t get the job?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;and-heres-the-pitch-for-job-hound&quot;&gt;And Here’s the Pitch for Job Hound&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end result of all this was that while I did end up with a full time job, I also ended up creating a new &lt;strong&gt;free&lt;/strong&gt; product, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jobhound.io&quot;&gt;Job Hound&lt;/a&gt; to make applying for tech jobs (generally programming) easier.  Job Hound is a job application tracking system and it puts the job application firmly in charge of the process.  I built it because after I had applied for about 15 jobs, I had no idea where I was in the process and I couldn’t give my wife a decent answer about my progress because I simply had no idea.  Job Hound isn’t a SAAS product, it is 100% free and I’d encourage you to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jobhound.io&quot;&gt;My new free product is Job Hound: Make applying for tech jobs suck less!  Sign Up Today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also here is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/posts/job-hound&quot;&gt;Job Hound on Product Hunt&lt;/a&gt; in case you want to toss me an upvote.  Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion-and-what-this-means-for-the-industry-and-the-job-seeker&quot;&gt;Conclusion and What this Means for the Industry and the Job Seeker&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t underestimate these changes to the hiring process and their impact on the industry as a whole.  Here’s how I see things changing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decreased job mobility&lt;/strong&gt;.  If jobs are harder to get then engineers will be less willing to change roles than they have been in the past.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower salaries&lt;/strong&gt;.  Generally speaking the easiest way to get a raise as an engineer is to leave your job.  If jobs are harder to get then less people will leave and that will drive salaries down.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Less Cross Pollination of Ideas&lt;/strong&gt;.  While companies may not like job mobility, I would argue that on the whole it has been good for high tech in general.  By engineers moving freely across companies, we’ve seen a great dissemination of engineering techniques and approaches.  If engineers lose job mobility then that will absolutely change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given how high tech has been such a tool for job creation over the past few decades, I really don’t like the implication of these trends but I do see them as very, very real.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Using Elastic Search and Rails for a Compound Query with Text Strings and User ID</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m writing this blog post, my first in quite a while, because I recently had to implement &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-rails&quot;&gt;ElasticSearch for Rails&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jobhound.io&quot;&gt;new application I’m building&lt;/a&gt; and I find life in the Elastic world a bit different than I had expected.  If you’re an Elastic Search veteran then you should definitely move along because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is fairly basic&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m writing this mostly to cement this in my own brain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curiously I found very few examples about how to do this type of compound query in Rails and that’s also part of my motivation for writing it.  The closest example I found was in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19381199/how-to-perform-elasticsearch-query-on-records-from-only-a-certain-user-rails-ti/49900343#49900343&quot;&gt;four year old Stack Overflow post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-problem-everyone-should-see-only-their-own-data&quot;&gt;The Problem: Everyone Should See Only Their Own Data&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a series of ActiveRecord models that I want to be able to search using Elastic Search.  This can easily be done with this code fragment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Job.search_user(params[:q])
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that I was initially the only user on this code base, I didn’t even notice the issue until I thought about deployment.  At which point there was the obligatory light bulb / I’m an idiot moment.  The problem here is that this code searches everyone’s jobs, not just the jobs that &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; created.  Now since every bit of data encompasses a user_id attribute, this should boil down to two problems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Getting user_id into the index&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Constructing a JSON query for ElasticSearch to execute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;sidebar-but-what-about-searchkick&quot;&gt;Sidebar: But What About SearchKick&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure a number of people are shouting out “Use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ankane/searchkick&quot;&gt;SearchKick&lt;/a&gt; (dummy)” but whenever I tried to use SearchKick, I got odd errors and I eventually just pulled it from Gemfile.  Given that I’m a long time believer in Ankane’s ChartKick, I’m sure it is me but I still couldn’t make use of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-1-getting-userid-into-the-index&quot;&gt;Step 1: Getting user_id into the Index&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve opted to setup each of my searchable models as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;include Elasticsearch::Model
include Elasticsearch::Model::Callbacks

settings do
  mappings dynamic: false do
    indexes :company^5, type: :text, analyzer: :english
    indexes :title^5, type: :text, analyzer: :english
    indexes :why_rejected, type: :text, analyzer: :english
    indexes :location, type: :text, analyzer: :english
    indexes :name, type: :text, analyzer: :english
    indexes :domain, type: :text, analyzer: :english
    indexes :created_at, type: :date
    indexes :user_id, type: :text
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The :title^5 bumps the ranking of search results in the title or company attributes by a factor of 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-2-constructing-the-json-query&quot;&gt;Step 2: Constructing the JSON query&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up with a class method on each of my searchable objects like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;def self.search_user(query, user)
  self.search({
    query: {
      bool: {
        must: [
        {
          multi_match: {
            query: query,
            fields: [:company, :title, :description, :name]
          }
        },
        {
          match: {
            user_id: user.id.to_s
          }
        }]
      }
    }
  })
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can call this from my search controller like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;@jobs = Job.search_user(params[:q], current_user)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and get results bound only to the logged in user – exactly what I was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-3-re-indexing-everything&quot;&gt;Step 3: Re-indexing Everything&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making changes to your settings / mappings, you need to re-index everything.  I handle this with a simple rake task like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;namespace :search do
  # bundle exec rake search:index_all --trace
  task :index_all =&amp;gt; :environment do
    klasses = [Job, Note, CoverLetter, Task]
    klasses.each do |klass|
      klass.send(:import, :force =&amp;gt; true)
    end
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This re-indexes every model in full.  You don’t always need this but it is very convenient to have for development when you’re playing with schema changes and the like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;recommended-reading&quot;&gt;Recommended Reading&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made heavy use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iridakos.com/tutorials/2017/12/03/elasticsearch-and-rails-tutorial.html&quot;&gt;Iridakos’s excellent tutorial&lt;/a&gt; and I recommend you do too.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Converting from FactoryGirl to FactoryBot</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This blog post talks about the renaming of FactoryGirl to FactoryBoy  and the necessary refactoring that you have to do to a current Rails app to support it.  The official guide to converting your Rails from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot/blob/4-9-0-stable/UPGRADE_FROM_FACTORY_GIRL.md&quot;&gt;FactoryGirl to FactoryBot&lt;/a&gt; is here.  Their solution is a search and replace approach and while that works, I wanted to go thru this step by step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-0-update-your-gemfile&quot;&gt;Step 0: Update Your Gemfile&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to change your Gemfile from FactoryGirl to FactoryBot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;gem &quot;factory_bot_rails&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-1-specsupportfactorygirlrb&quot;&gt;Step 1: spec/support/factory_girl.rb&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This file needs to be renamed from spec/support/factory_girl.rb to spec/support/factory_bot.rb and then the contents changed to reflect it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.include FactoryBot::Syntax::Methods
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-2-specrailshelperrb&quot;&gt;Step 2: spec/rails_helper.rb&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on your RSpec configuration you may not need to adjust this file.  In my case I was using FactoryGirl to create an @user variable so I had to adjust this as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;@user = FactoryBot.create(:user, options)    
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-3-specfactoriesrb&quot;&gt;Step 3: spec/factories/*.rb&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of your factories needs to be rewritten to call FactoryBot not FactoryGirl so you’ll have a structure something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;FactoryBot.define do
  factory :user do
    email { Faker::Internet.email }
    username Faker::Name.first_name.downcase
    password &quot;Sample:1&quot;
    password_confirmation &quot;Sample:1&quot;
    first_name Faker::Name.first_name
    last_name Faker::Name.last_name
    active true
    confirmed true
  end
end    
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-4-your-actual-spec-files&quot;&gt;Step 4: Your Actual Spec Files&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In each of your spec files, you’ll need to change calls from FactoryGirl.create to FactoryBot.create like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;@job = FactoryBot.create(:job, :user_id =&amp;gt; User.first.id)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-5-also-check-specspechelperrb&quot;&gt;Step 5: Also Check spec/spec_helper.rb&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also check spec/spec_helper.rb as this is a common place where you may have located some Factory* type of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall this was a simpler conversion than I had expected.  Admittedly this was done in a relatively small &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jobhound.io&quot;&gt;Rails MVP&lt;/a&gt; but it really was pretty painless.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Enabling Github Security Alerts on Your Private Repositories</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Github recently announced that they would be providing &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/blog/2470-introducing-security-alerts-on-github&quot;&gt;security alerts for github repositories&lt;/a&gt;.  These alerts let you know when a dependency that you’re relying on has a critical vulnerability.  Given the importance of security, this is an excellent idea.  Thank you Github!  These alerts are turned on automatically for public repositories but they require you to opt in for your private repositories.  And while this isn’t hard, Github doesn’t make it clear exactly how to set this option for your private repositories.  I just spent an hour or so turning this on for all my private repositories and here’s the step by step approach:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.github.com&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Login if you’re not logged in.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Navigate to your dashboard.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to your repositories list by clicking on the repositories link in the header.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select a private repository by clicking on it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select the Settings link.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scroll down to &lt;strong&gt;Data services&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn on “Allow Github to perform read-only analysis of this repository”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn on Dependency graph.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn on Vulnerability alerts.  You should note that Github saves the status of each of these via ajax as you check them off so there’s no Save button you need to click.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you need to navigate back to repositories and turn this on for any other private repositories that you have. Given the number of private Rails apps I have repositories for, I’m really, really glad I turned this on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: Its unclear exactly how long it takes to build the Dependency graph and for the Vulnerability alert scan to be completed.  I don’t think it is immediate so you might want to keep an eye on the home page for your repos over the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Forensic Computing 2 - Kernel Panics and Kexts</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As I’ve noted in &lt;a href=&quot;http://fuzzyblog.io/blog/text/2017/10/08/forensic-computing-1-finding-textmate-untitled-documents.html&quot;&gt;other places&lt;/a&gt;, my Mac crashes a lot.  For some time now I’ve just sort of accepted this as a consequence of how I do things.  I’m a software developer and I tend to push the limits of everything.  Part of the reason that I accept it is that my computing usage is more than a bit non standard and I suspect that I’m running up against nothing more than resource limits.  Just as an example, at the start of my day, my terminal count looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ps auwwx | grep bash | wc -l
      50
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s at the start of my computing day (I open a lot of terminals and generally leave them running).  Just as a side note, my desktop Hackintosh, with double the RAM, also running OSX is pretty much rock solid so I tend to view this as a resource issue.  But what if it is not?  What if this is a solvable software issue?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;analyzing-kernel-panics&quot;&gt;Analyzing Kernel Panics&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to figure this out, I took a number of my kernel panics and put them online as gists:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/fuzzygroup/ab3a4c81edb3fa80910e25fc12e49993&quot;&gt;October 8th&lt;/a&gt;.  Yes this one happened while I was writing this all down.  Damn it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/fuzzygroup/97bc867094294a2b724f5860d04d09ab&quot;&gt;October 7th&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/fuzzygroup/30ee32761f72d55d1fe8b870dbdc04af&quot;&gt;September 30th&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/fuzzygroup/137e695b9ed5cc2d2ebcda8c983616a4&quot;&gt;August 27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[September 11](https://gist.github.com/fuzzygroup/5e41b8ccdcdf6c8bf95bbe002aa158&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I’ve been reading these crash by crash, I always attributed it to randomness since there was no consistent application that seemed to cause the crash (WindowServer was the most common but by no means the sole thing).  But there is a lot of information in these reports and the application when it crashed perhaps isn’t the only thing I should be caring about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noticed one interesting thing in going thru the above kernel panics (oh and by the way, you can find many of these logs in /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/).  They are all named something like Kernel_2017-09-16-132730_FuzzygroupMacbookPro2016.panic.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-us/TS3742&quot;&gt;Thanks Apple&lt;/a&gt;.  What I noticed was that the kext (Kernel Extension) that always is last loaded is com.github.kbfuse.filesystems.kbfuse which belongs to KeyBase.  This is a part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://keybase.io/&quot;&gt;Keybase&lt;/a&gt; which is a very cool crypto app.  This extension is apparently part of the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://keybase.io/docs/kbfs&quot;&gt;Keybase Filesystem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A kext is a kernel extension and that basically means “code that extends the lowest level of the operating system (the kernel)”.  Fuse is a toolkit that lets you write filesystems in user space and what I do remember about the Fuse project is that I’ve seen a lot of flakiness / crashes over the years from Fuse related stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick google for the term &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?tbs=li:1&amp;amp;q=osx+fuse+kernel+panic&quot;&gt;osx kernel panic fuse&lt;/a&gt; gave me 49,100 results so I’m not the only one thinking this.  Googling instead for (com.github.kbfuse.filesystems.kbfuse)[https://www.google.com/search?tbs=li:1&amp;amp;q=com.github.kbfuse.filesystems.kbfuse] took me to the github page for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/keybase/client/tree/master/osx/Fuse&quot;&gt;keybase fuse project&lt;/a&gt; where I found the following uninstallation directions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Check for any mounts (if there are you need to umount)
mount -t kbfuse

sudo kextunload -b com.github.kbfuse.filesystems.kbfuse
sudo rm -rf /Library/Filesystems/kbfuse.fs
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-next&quot;&gt;What Next?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve done these steps and now I need to just wait and see if my system stability improves.  I also deleted the Keybase application entirely because its unclear to me what happens to Keybase if I delete a kext that it is using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In closing, I’d like to add that I am not the only person who is reporting an issue with this kext and kernel panics.  Here’s an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/keybase/client/issues/5190&quot;&gt;open Github thread&lt;/a&gt; on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;update&quot;&gt;Update&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of 24 hours later, my Mac has crashed two more times so the kext apparently had nothing to do with it, alas.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Forensic Computing 1 - Finding TextMate Untitled Documents</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So my Mac crashed again last night.  This is now roughly a two to three times per week occurrence.  Once upon a time I would have sworn like a sailor about this but I now, sadly, accept it.  If you’re curious about OSX crashes and kernel panics, I dig into &lt;a href=&quot;http://fuzzyblog.io/blog/osx/2017/10/08/forensic-computing-2-kernel-panics-and-kexts.html&quot;&gt;them here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://macromates.com/&quot;&gt;TextMate&lt;/a&gt; is the programming editor and writing tool I use and normally after a crash, it automatically opens all the documents I previously had open.  And when I say “all”, I mean everything, even the things that weren’t ever formally saved i.e. “untitled 107”, “untitled 132”, etc.  Because TextMate doesn’t force met to assign a file, I’m able to treat TextMate windows as virtual pieces of paper, virtual post-its if you will and just drop stuff into them.  I only bother to save a file when I actually need to make it long term persistent.  And an awful lot of the time, that never happens.  Sometimes these the contents of these windows flows into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/&quot;&gt;gist&lt;/a&gt; which then gets emailed to someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this bizarre “don’t bother to save the file” approach is well and good until it &lt;strong&gt;breaks&lt;/strong&gt;.  Last night, just before my machine crashed, I know for a fact that I was in &lt;strong&gt;untitled 30&lt;/strong&gt;.  But when I restarted my machine, I noticed that untitled 30 wasn’t in my Window list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/textmate_window_list.png&quot; alt=&quot;/blog/textmate_window_list.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This literally sent a chill down my spine – if untitled 30 isn’t present then:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Where did it go?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How often has this happened?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What other untitled xyz files have I unknowingly lost?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Where on the blankety, blank computer is untitled 30 stored so I can bloody well find it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions 1 and 2 simply cannot be answered but questions 3 and 4 are actually answerable.  If I can simply find out where TextMate stores its untitled files then I can browse the directory and find them.  I should also then be able to find untitled 30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-1-google&quot;&gt;Step 1: Google&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever you are trying to understand something like this Google is generally your first place to look.  Unfortunately these googles didn’t really yield anything:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?tbs=li:1&amp;amp;q=where+does+textmate+store+untitled+files&quot;&gt;where does textmate store untitled files&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?tbs=li:1&amp;amp;q=where+does+textmate+store+untitled+files&quot;&gt;textmate untitled&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-2-spotlight&quot;&gt;Step 2: Spotlight&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OSX’s Spotlight, the system level search engine was next.  This too yielded nothing, squat, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bupkus&quot;&gt;bupkus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-3-alfred&quot;&gt;Step 3: Alfred&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The filename search engine in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alfredapp.com/&quot;&gt;Alfred&lt;/a&gt; which you trigger with your Alfred hotkey plus the keyword open and then what you want to search yielded nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-4-mdfind&quot;&gt;Step 4: mdfind&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to use Spotlight is to trigger the mdfind utility from the command line and look for the filename untitled 30 directly by typing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;mdfind “untitled”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The output of mdfind is a list of filenames.  But, unfortunately, mdfind isn’t, by default, for filenames which means that it finds the word untitled in the &lt;em&gt;body of documents&lt;/em&gt; where as we want it in the filename itself. Just to be sure we can feed the mdfind’s output thru grep to winnow it down:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;mdfind untitled&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;grep untitled&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a -name option to mdfind but that also returned nothing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;mdfind -name untitled&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cool as Hell Sidenote&lt;/strong&gt;: In looking up &lt;a href=&quot;http://osxdaily.com/2017/08/24/find-all-screenshots-mac/&quot;&gt;details on mdfind&lt;/a&gt;, I found this very, very cool command line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;mdfind kMDItemIsScreenCapture:1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What that does is find every screenshot you’ve taken on your Mac.  And I don’t mean files named “Screen Shot xyz” but any screenshot you’ve ever taken, even ones you’ve moved to other directories, renamed, etc.  Wow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-5-look-elsewhere&quot;&gt;Step 5: Look Elsewhere&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the absence of results in Steps 2, 3 and 4 gave me a strong indication that what I was looking for wasn’t in an indexed location and that gave me a clue.  Spotlight  and mdfind are both generally looking in the files for the user but NOT in the application level files.  OSX has a key directory structure for users that generally isn’t indexed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;/Users/sjohnson/Library/Application Support/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I know for a fact there is a TextMate directory below it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;/Users/sjohnson/Library/Application Support/TextMate/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I didn’t know was what was below the TextMate directory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ls -l &quot;/Users/sjohnson/Library/Application Support/TextMate/&quot;
total 6488

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, yep, &lt;strong&gt;bingo&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Session/&lt;/em&gt;.  A quick look there showed me all my untitled documents including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ls -l /Users/sjohnson/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Session/untitled\ 30*

-rw-r--r--@ 1 sjohnson  staff   5.3K Sep 13 04:23 /Users/sjohnson/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Session/untitled 30.txt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now that I have a path I can just type open “/Users/sjohnson/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Session” and get a Finder window of all my untitled documents like this:&lt;/p&gt;
