        <title>CodeTree Rebuttal on Buying a SAAS App</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kareem&quot;&gt;Kareem Mayan&lt;/a&gt; and his co-founders over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codetree.com&quot;&gt;CodeTree&lt;/a&gt; recently wrote an interesting piece - &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.codetree.com/articles/a-framework-for-picking-and-funding-your-business-idea.html&quot;&gt;A Framework for picking and funding your business idea&lt;/a&gt; and this is really a great piece.  It is refreshingly analytical and methodical in terms of picking your opportunity.  Personally I’m more of a technologist than full on business guy so I learned quite a bit about discipline from this.  However, there’s one aspect of it I wanted to comment on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The reason for buying small SaaS businesses is that it’s so hard to start anything from scratch. Even a business doing only $5,000 in MRR has validated something significant, and that makes the business valuable.” 
- &lt;a href=&quot;http://hiten.com/issues/97&quot;&gt;Hiten Shah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intellectually I agree with this and it is one of the &lt;strong&gt;exact&lt;/strong&gt; reasons that I bought a SAAS business in May of 2015.  While I can’t disclose the particular business but, after buying it, I saw sales largely collapse by a factor of 6x over a 18 month period and I thought discussing why might be interesting.  Here’s what went wrong:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;loss-of-marketing&quot;&gt;Loss of Marketing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I bought this business I did not realize how strongly it was generating its sales as a function of inherent web traffic it got from other things the previous owner did.  And I don’t think that there was a way to actually know this which bothers me to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;inability-to-generate-new-sales-from-google-ads&quot;&gt;Inability to Generate New Sales from Google Ads&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people on the web think “need sales - I know, I’ll run google ads!”.  What I found is that Google ads are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;far harder to make work than you think&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;make damn sure that you look at the when / where settings on Google ads.  We lost a bunch of money due to our ads being shown globally instead of US only / EST to PST since that’s where like 95% of our sales came from.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;have a lot more complexity now (2015 / 2016) than that did even 2 years ago&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;don’t work all that well if the monthly price of your SAAS is at the multiple hundreds of dollars point&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;can be used aggressively against you - you run an ad and your bigger competitors can simply outspend you&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;finding a vendor who can actually help you with google ads is hard.  Lots of people want to help you but few of them seem to be any good.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;not everything can be sold via adwords.  One of the new products we released was a market research report that we later found out was on a topic area which could not be advertised on Adwords.  My co-founder headed this up and the inability to market it was killer for us since we had planned this effort as a loss leader to jump start subscription sales.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;big-competitors-can-be-deadly&quot;&gt;Big Competitors Can Be Deadly&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a market space with one really big competitor and in any competitive market space if the market leader decides to, well, they can make things very, very hard for you.  What we found is that however we spent on Adwords, they would match it and boost the click thru price.  It isn’t illegal, immoral or fattening but it did &lt;strong&gt;feel wrong&lt;/strong&gt;.  And that’s not even talking about the disastrous impact that can hit your business if competitors decide to maliciously click on your ads and run up your bill / prevent traffic from getting to you.  I know that this isn’t supposed to happen but when you’re at the small, small, small side of Adwords and you’re trying to figure out what works, your budgets aren’t large.  This means that a sharp competitor might see the keywords you’re running and just plain screw with you.  And you’ll never know but since you are using a test marketing budget what you see is “Keyword X brought in no sales; guess it is time to move onto the next one”.  And maybe it was exactly the right keyword.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;take-aways&quot;&gt;Take Aways&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;See if you can answer the question “If this SAAS business leaves its current owner, what does the business lose in web traffic, referrals and other things - does that make the business less viable?”  And don’t forget that a lot of web traffic these days comes from a founder’s personal blog / web presence.  If you just look at corporate web traffic, you ignore that.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If your plan is to use Google Ads as a mechanism for sales then &lt;strong&gt;spend your own money,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;before the acquisition&lt;/em&gt;, to verify that Google Ads actually work for this business.  I’m still kicking myself daily that I didn’t focus on generating new sales and test Google Ads for this.  Even spending a thousand dollars out of pocket prior to the acquisition might have saved me far, far more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t ignore social media.  When all this was going on, I did not focus on content marketing - blogging / tweeting.  I wish that I had and I wonder how it would have turned out.  However, at the time, I had my hands full with migrating the data center and revitalizing a code base that the previous owner had neglected.  Sigh; too little time; too many bytes to push around.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be careful about large entrenched competitors.  I’ve always been from the school of thought - small and nimble can win the race.  This is only so true these days.  When the number of engineers that they have dwarfs you by an order of magnitude or more, well, that’s going to hurt. I seem to have bought this just at an inflection point where their funding jumped and I got hit in the crossfire.  Sigh.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>A Template for Rails 5 Apps with MySQL, Capistrano, Devise</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite my recent focus on Elixir, I still make most of my money doing Rails.  Here’s a template that &lt;a href=&quot;http://dasari.me/&quot;&gt;Dv&lt;/a&gt; and I put together yesterday for a modern Rails 5 app:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Devise&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MySQL&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Capistrano&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Docker (not entirely finished yet but it is a start)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fuzzygroup/baseline_devise_template&quot;&gt;GitHub Template for a new Rails App&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fork it, clone it, bundle install and the like.  Enjoy.  I’ve done this so many times recently that I thought it was better to do it once and then use that as a baseline moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes on Devise&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re trying to understand Devise and how its changed in Rails 5 then you’ll need these links:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sitepoint.com/devise-authentication-in-depth/&quot;&gt;https://www.sitepoint.com/devise-authentication-in-depth/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://launchschool.com/blog/how-to-use-devise-in-rails-for-authentication&quot;&gt;https://launchschool.com/blog/how-to-use-devise-in-rails-for-authentication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/plataformatec/devise&quot;&gt;https://github.com/plataformatec/devise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally I have a love / hate relationship with Devise.  It always feels hard to get started (part of the reason I made a template) but I have huge respect for the degree of outstanding great work, love and care that &lt;a href=&quot;http://plataformatec.com.br/&quot;&gt;Platformatec&lt;/a&gt; put into it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Small World - CodeTree vs ZenHub for GitHub</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Note: I started this on the trip down to ElixirCon but failed to finish it then so its about a week out of date but still relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My father, a small businessman his whole life, has always commented to me on how the &lt;strong&gt;small&lt;/strong&gt; nature of any industry.  And he has always cautioned me to maintain an outstanding personal reputation for integrity because of that.  As I’m traveling down to ElixirCon and in line to buy a burrito, I see a notification on my phone “&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@kareem.m/how-to-avoid-building-a-company-that-youll-hate-d1eb76eb9a9d#.46ocftpmy&quot;&gt;Kareem Mayan published … &lt;/a&gt;” in the Medium app.  Wow.  It is a small world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the late, un-lamented eduFire, Kareem was the co-founder and one of two guys who hired me.  Because of him I dove ever more deeply into Ruby and took on Rails back in the pre 1.0 days.  He didn’t even balk, when on my second week on the job I came down with Pneumonia in the summer and spent a week incommunicado.  That was also the week that I finished all the Harry Potter books but thanks to the fever, I was still surprised in the last movie (really - he died; dang!).  Quite literally he changed my life for the better.  He also strongly encouraged our move from subversion to git which was hugely important.  Understanding version control is one of those seminal skills for a software developer and git made me better at it than I ever was with subversion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sidebar:&lt;/strong&gt; Say what you will about Ruby / Rails but I’ve been employed more than full time since 2007 due to Ruby / Rails and the $$$ I make from it have been transformative.  It has also leveled up my skills dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway I’m back in the market for real development tools with a new hire coming on board at my day job and what is Kareem doing?  Well he’s one of the people behind &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codetree.com/&quot;&gt;CodeTree&lt;/a&gt; which competes with the other tool I’m looking at, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zenhub.com&quot;&gt;ZenHub&lt;/a&gt;.  So it really is a small world - I haven’t thought about Kareem in probably 7 years now and all I knew was he went full “Digital Nomad” for quite a while.  And now he’s providing an interesting tool and one of the owners of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;** To the Comparison&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;marketing materials&lt;/strong&gt;.  CodeTree’s site looks awful on an iPhone.  That impacts nothing on the tool itself but when you’re considering tooling and looking the site on an iPhone, well, appearance counts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;browser support&lt;/strong&gt;.  ZenHub is tied heavily to Chrome as a browser.  That concerns me a lot because I use a bunch of different machines, iPad and such.  CodeTree doesn’t seem to have such limitations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pricing&lt;/strong&gt;.  Pricing is similar although CodeTree is more affordable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kareem reached out to me via email when he saw that I had signed up for a CodeTree trial.  This to me is a hugely good sign because it means that a real live person is reviewing every single new sales lead and considering them.  When I reached out to him and asked him some questions, here was his response:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two key reasons that people choose Codetree vs. Zenhub:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People who are responsible for delivery like Project Managers or technical leads really like the table view that groups issues by Assignee or Milestone.  Tables are information-dense which gives them a good overview of what’s going on in the project, though we also have Kanban to visualize issues as they move through your delivery pipeline.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We handle milestones and labels across multiple repos better than anybody else.  If you create a milestone or label in a Codetree project that spans N repos, we’ll create that milestone or label in all the repos automatically.  Last I checked ZenHub creates it in the main repo but you have to create it in the other repos.  This is most useful for when multiple repos are part of the same product (API repo, front end repo, mobile repo, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If your PM doesn’t like or want tables and doesn’t mind or need to create milestones and labels manually, or wants to stay in the GH UI, then ZenHub is a fine option.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while there’s a bit of snark in that last comment, these are valid points.  The thing that I keep coming back to on ZenHub is the implementation as a Chrome or Firefox plugin.  Perhaps I’m old school but abandoning the native browser on OSX, the iPad and the iPhone seems, well, foolish to me.  And the products do have a different experience level:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CodeTree is a separate site you sign into thru Github which acts as a project management overlay&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ZenHub is inside github entirely; its not a separate thing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up purchasing &lt;strong&gt;CodeTree&lt;/strong&gt; for the whole team and the core issue really was iPad support.  Both products work well enough and both product have some holes.  And while CodeTree’s marketing materials didn’t render well on a phone, the product works quite well on an iPad.  I find that an iPad is an increasingly vital “second screen” for a developer.  Not only does having one force you to make sure that your UI experience doesn’t render poorly on a mobile device but it allows a developer to fork the all too common research tasks to the kitchen table, park, starbucks, etc.  Given the sheer amount of stuff that any developer has to read, iPads are pretty essential these days.  In fact they are essential enough that I specified one as part of the core gear given to our latest hire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sidebar: Knowing Kareem&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So was this purely about the feature set or did my knowing one of the founders affect things?  I’d love to say it was purely objective but I’m sure that knowing Kareem was part of CodeTree was a factor.  Its always a pleasure to reconnect with an old friend and this was no different.  Still the overwhelming factor was browser support. I don’t always carry a laptop but I do always have an iPad these days.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gluten Free Fettuccine Alfredo That is Actually Good</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I don’t write much about cooking here - I save recipes for my &lt;a href=&quot;http://fuzzygroup.github.io/recipes/&quot;&gt;recipe blog&lt;/a&gt; - but I’m particularly proud of this one - A Gluten Free Fettuccine Alfredo that is actually good.  My wife ate it and my sons inhaled it.  No one complained about the gluten free nature.  My wife suffers from celiac disease and really hasn’t had pasta in the past 5 years now.  Yes there have been a few rice noodles when I made Pad Thai from scratch but pasta in the luxurious italian sense?  Nope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran across a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cookscountry.com/recipes/8991-fettuccine-with-butter-and-cheese?incode=MKSKZ00L0&amp;amp;ref=search_results_1&quot;&gt;Fettuccine recipe in Cooks Country&lt;/a&gt; recently and thought “With the right noodle, my wife would adore that” and I came up with this.  Quantities have been adjusted to fit the noodles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-recipe&quot;&gt;The Recipe&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The noodle I chose was&lt;a href=&quot;https://jovialfoods.com/product/egg-tagliatelle-gluten-free-brown-rice-pasta/&quot;&gt; Jovial’s Tagliatelle&lt;/a&gt; and it is excellent.  There’s none of the grittiness / bitterness you all too often find in gluten free foods.  I suspect the reason it is so good is that it is an egg noodle and the lack of ingredients / extenders - Brown Rice Flour, Eggs.  That’s it.  Highly, highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final note – when I made this I didn’t cheap out and get low end cheese and butter.  Since these were the primary ingredients beyond the noodles, I sprung for the good stuff.  And it made a huge difference much to my surprise.  I used Kerry Gold butter and it was delightful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ingredients&quot;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;9 oz tagliatelle&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Salt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4 oz parmigiano-reggiano (2 cups, grated)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5 tbsp butter cut into 5 or more pieces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;steps&quot;&gt;Steps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bring 3 quarts of water to a boil (that’s 12 cups) and add pasta and 1 tbsp salt to it once boiling.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cook for 11 minutes and then save 3/4 cup of the water in a measuring cup for the next stage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drain pasta in colander and add back to pan.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn heat to low and add water, butter and cheese and toss vigorously with tongs for 1 minute.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn off heat and cover for 1 minute.  Add salt to taste and serve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Startup Learnings - What Dave McClure Taught Me</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Feedster was not the first company I raised money for but it was the first time I raised money from true silicon valley investors.  I vividly remember &lt;a href=&quot;https://fuzzygroup.github.io/blog/startup/2016/09/02/what-scott-rafer-taught-me.html&quot;&gt;Scott Rafer&lt;/a&gt; taking me around all the different angel groups, individual investors and Sand Hill Road.  One of those investors was &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davemcclure&quot;&gt;Dave McClure&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://500.co&quot;&gt;500 Startups&lt;/a&gt; fame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave was one of our angel investors the the one that I felt personally responsible for.  So, after the awful day that I was let go from Feedster, I remember sitting in my apartment in Indianapolis and having to call Dave around 6 pm on a cold fall night and telling him that I was gone and I couldn’t look out for his investment any longer.  He took the news far better than I expected and wasn’t even angry or disappointed with me much to my surprise.  His actual concern was how I was taking everything.  Looking back at this, I can now see it a little differently:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We were just one of many investments that he had&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The amount wasn’t all that large&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preserving the relationship with the entrepreneur is more important; they’ll do something else&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here’s what Dave McClure taught me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not everything works out.  And that’s ok.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relationships matter.  Keep relationships strong no matter what.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I don’t think I’ve talked to Dave in years at this point but the truth of it is that I’m still impressed by how well he handled this and I still remember it vividly.  And If anyone ever asked me if they should take Dave on as an investor, I’d answer “Yes; a thousand times yes.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Apple,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love you dearly – you know that.  I’ve been running a Mac since the Mac Plus days and while my attentions have strayed from time to time, in my house there are more boxes running some kind of Apple OS than any other.  And while I’d love to see a better phone, longer battery life, etc, there’s just one thing I really want:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make iPhone Syncing Less of an Absolute Suck Fest!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is 5:30 am as I write this and I’ve been sitting at my wife’s computer for the past hour trying to get her iPhone to sync properly so that if she can buy a new phone there will be no data loss.  This is exactly how I spent the day of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;iPhone 4 launch&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;iPhone 5 launch&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;iPhone 6 launch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, while I’m used to this, it doesn’t make it suck any less.  It is also how I spent yesterday morning when all my attempts to sync her phone came to naught.  And while you know these, &lt;em&gt;why, oh dear lord, why&lt;/em&gt; does synching an iPhone in 2016 suck so much more than synching my PalmPilot III in 1998?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/200px-Palm_III_24.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Synch Used to Work Well!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how things use to work back in the day:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;put palm pilot in cradle&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;press button&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;done!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while I remember an occasional conflict, mostly due to editing contact info on desktop and palm pilot concurrently, it wasn’t the unending suck fest that iPhone synch has become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, for example, was yesterday:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;issues with some photo / video that wouldn’t move over so I had to synch the pictures by batches until the offending bit of data was skipped over&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;some apps weren’t synched because of computer authorization&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 songs were lost because she had exceeded her 5 computer authorization limit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the synch never finished because the machine ran out of space partway through&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last one, running out of space, is particularly egregious – you know how big the damn device is, its size.  If there isn’t a multiple of that size in free disc space then simply don’t start the synch!  Don’t let it fail part of the way through!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobile devices are no longer a new concept.  Synch should be painless.  It should be plug in a cable, leave the device alone and its done.  Instead synching an iPhone is always &lt;strong&gt;connect and pray&lt;/strong&gt;.  And while I have nothing against prayer, it shouldn’t be a requirement to use a mobile device.  Honestly, after yesterday and today, I sort of feel that this should be my new iPhone synch process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kneel&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pray&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go in backyard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sacrifice goat in dead of night while changing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect lightning cable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chant&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hope for the best&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repeat until synched&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while I’d love to see a waterproof iPhone or wireless charging or something else, I’d settle for the product that I paid good money for just working a little better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– Scott&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>AWS Tutorial 06 - Getting Your Instance ID and Why It Matters</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the world of AWS, your server is referred to as an EC2 instance and it is uniquely identified by a “instance-id”, a unique alpha numeric identifier that you can use to reference your server.  Your instance id can be used in all kinds of ways including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;log files&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;database records&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;security analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case I’m using AWS to crawl different websites and one of the things I’m encountering is that it is very, very hard to know what AWS instance ty;e is the best value.  Specifically do I optimize for more memory, more CPU, more disk and so on.  One thing you can do is push your instance id right down to the unit of work.  In my case that’s a database transaction so I can do things like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;select instance_id, count(*) from page2016_q3s where instance_id is not null group by instance_id;
+---------------------+----------+
| instance_id         | count(*) |
+---------------------+----------+
| i-03ce34f1b92a3c72b |     1514 |
| i-045b17850658399ae |     1698 |
| i-0715d32f41c06b98f |     1731 |
+---------------------+----------+
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if these 3 different instance types, and they were all started at the same time, I can see that, well, they’re all doing roughly the same amount of work so maybe the instance type doesn’t matter all that much and I should just buy the cheapest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how you fetch the instance id – and its brilliantly simple – you can just use wget or curl.  Here’s an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that will return back a chunk of information which is just the instance id.  Want your region instead then just use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/placement/availability-zone
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you’re looking to understand what’s available then just call:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And  you can walk down each of the options one by one looking at what’s available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a ruby implementation of how to get this info and cache it for faster retrieval.  This is in our common module which is a generic set of class methods we use all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;def self.instance_id
  #
  # abend unless we&#39;re in production mode
  #
  return &quot;&quot; unless Rails.env.production?

  #
  # pull from cache
  #
  cache_key = &quot;#{Common.ip_address}|instance_id&quot;
  cache = Common.get_mem_cache
  instance_id = cache.read(cache_key)
  return instance_id unless instance_id.nil?
  
  #
  # fetch from metadata service, cache and return
  #
  begin
    agent = Mechanize.new
    url = &quot;http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id&quot;
    page = agent.get(url)
    instance_id = page.body

    #
    # Now cache it
    #
    cache.write(cache_key, instance_id)

    return instance_id
  rescue StandardError =&amp;gt; e
    puts &quot;Hit error: #{e}&quot;
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Common.ip_address technique can be found on &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14112955/how-to-get-my-machines-ip-address-from-ruby-without-leveraging-from-other-ip-ad/39367219#39367219&quot;&gt;stack overflow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>AWS - An Example of Development Speed with AWS</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Just as an example of how fast things can happen in the AWS world, I skyped over to a colleague “I think we need another crawling box” at 3:48 am this morning.  Then I took care of it and got that box up and running.  My response back to him was at 4:09 am.  So 12 + 9 or 21 minutes total to go from a 5 node installation to a 6 node installation.  Coming from the world of traditional hosting where the flow is more like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;email hosting company&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;explain what is needed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;go back and forth a few times&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;wait a day or two&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;run chef on the box to configure everything and have it half broken at the end because, well, chef&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;fix it manually&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;get code deployed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;deal with randomness&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;get it running&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My usual turn around time on getting a new box is close to a week when all is said and done so 21 minutes feels like, well, &lt;strong&gt;magic&lt;/strong&gt;.  And, honestly, I could have done it faster.  I muddled about a bit, checked mail, read a tweet or two, etc.  Now if I had properly scripted everything, this could have been probably less than 5 minutes end to end.  I’m not yet at that point in my AWS journey (still using the AWS web tools step by step).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rails2Elixir - rake spec</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The command &lt;strong&gt;rake spec&lt;/strong&gt; runs your rspec test suite.  The equivalent in the Elixir world is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mix test
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Rails2Elixir - rake db:migrate</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the Rails world, rake db:migrate stands for “migrate the database and execute the latest migrations”.  In the Elixir world the &lt;strong&gt;mix&lt;/strong&gt; command fills the role that the rake and rails executables used to.  The equivalent in the Elixir world is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mix ecto.migrate
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
