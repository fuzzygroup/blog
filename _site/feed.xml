        <title>Understanding Systems By Observation - Dropbox</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the best bits of computer science I ever learned, I learned in 1989 from my first business partner, Brian Giedt.  We were at a Society for Technical Communications (stc) conference on Technical Documentation and my partner was trying to impress a pretty girl.  And I watch him look at an animation product and pretty much instantly &lt;strong&gt;grok&lt;/strong&gt; how it was doing the animation.  Where I saw a pretty flow of images, he looked at it and understood how the animation was being done.  That was the very first time I saw someone really understand something about the &lt;em&gt;internals&lt;/em&gt; from its &lt;em&gt;externals&lt;/em&gt;.  And once I knew it was possible – I’ve striven to do it as often as I can.  Very often, if you set up the right set of circumstances, you’ll realize exactly how something has to be implemented internally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s use Dropbox as an example.  We all know that Dropbox transfers the content you put in it to all other machines you have hooked up to it.  And that’s a simple 1 to many transfer.  But how does Dropbox work when you already have content in it and you re-arrange it?  Does it resend everything or does it figure out what it has to do and send a command stream to do it instead?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few minutes ago I:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;created a folder within a folder in Dropbox&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;moved about 15 gb of video files in initial folder to the new folder&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;checked on my iPad about a minute later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And all the files I moved were in the new folder already.  Here’s what this tells me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There’s no way that Dropbox deleted and re-transmitted the files in that time; it is simply impossible&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What Dropbox has to be doing is sending commands that amount to move THIS from HERE to THERE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best I’ve seen to do this is you set up conditions that you know can’t be argued with by physical constraints.  I knew that 15 gb of video data was a big arse chunk of data.  If I had used say a megabyte, well, I wouldn’t have really known if it was a full bandwidth re-arrange or a command stream.  By setting up such a large test, well, I knew something smarter had to be going on.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Thinking About a Ruby Driven AWS Lambda Approach for Big Data Computing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So I have a computing problem to solve where the amount of data to process vastly exceeds even my desire to spin up EC2 instances.  I really do actually enjoy &lt;a href=&quot;https://fuzzygroup.github.io/blog/tag.html#ansible&quot;&gt;Ansible&lt;/a&gt; but at some point you have to cry to the heavens and shout out “There must be a better way!”.  This is literally an “oh crap” moment when I realized exactly the scale of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: I’m not at liberty here to give specifics so I’m talking in generalities quite a bit in this post.  Apologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS has a lot of tools that can be applied to big data process but two come to mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/emr/&quot;&gt;Elastic Map Reduce&lt;/a&gt; or EMR&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/&quot;&gt;Lambda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EMR is older and harder to use so I’m going to avoid it for now in favor of the new hotness – &lt;strong&gt;Lambda&lt;/strong&gt;.  Here’s the brag statement about Lambda:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Run code without thinking about servers.
Pay for only the compute time you consume.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a pretty compelling statement to make and it is actually close to a holy grail of distributed computing.&lt;br /&gt;
I have a big data problem that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Involves about 15,000 unique domains that need to be checked against an index of data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Where if the domain is a match a secondary request needs to be made and several data points extracted from an api&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The results of #2 need to be posted to an API that we control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For valid separation of concerns issues the data fed into 1 is separate from the code in 1 (its driven by a separate git repo).  And all of our code is in Ruby which is not a supported Lambda language.  This raises some actual issues in terms of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do we make this work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do we get our existing ruby code to run in Lambda&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an interesting approach to packaging up our existing ruby code using Traveling Ruby and then run that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.krautcomputing.com/blog/2016/02/29/how-to-run-ruby-scripts-on-aws-lambda-using-ansible/&quot;&gt;package on Lambda&lt;/a&gt;.  But before we goto that level of effort perhaps we need to examine the metrics on the codebase in question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;rake stats
+----------------------+--------+--------+---------+---------+-----+-------+
| Name                 |  Lines |    LOC | Classes | Methods | M/C | LOC/M |

| Model tests          |      0 |      0 |       0 |       0 |   0 |     0 |
| Mailer tests         |      0 |      0 |       0 |       0 |   0 |     0 |
| Integration tests    |      0 |      0 |       0 |       0 |   0 |     0 |
| Lib specs            |    270 |    231 |       0 |       1 |   0 |   229 |
+----------------------+--------+--------+---------+---------+-----+-------+
| Total                |    808 |    629 |      18 |      40 |   2 |    13 |
+----------------------+--------+--------+---------+---------+-----+-------+
  Code LOC: 398     Test LOC: 231     Code to Test Ratio: 1:0.6
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we’re actually only talking about 12 classes, 38 methods and 366 LOC.  So this isn’t large at all.  We know that one approach to running this is running it as packaged ruby.  Another approach would be &lt;em&gt;code that writes code&lt;/em&gt; but before we talk about this, let’s talk about the execution context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This application needs to run every time period from 2013 to present.  And depending on the results from our initial prototype, that will be either monthly or quarterly.  So if this is quarterly we need to run it 12 times - (4 in 2013, 4 in 2015, 4 in 2016) and if its monthly then we need to run it 36 times.  And we’ll need to run it monthly going forward.  And, each time, the input data is different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;code-that-writes-code&quot;&gt;Code that Writes Code&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of different approaches to code that writes code – generators, real AI and template based approaches.  For this I would use a template based approach as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Port the Ruby code to JavaScript using a single file approach as much as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Locate the input data we need to send to the initial api near the top as essentially a global array of values.  For test purposes you only need to use 1 or 2; only enough to prove the concept.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Convert the code in #2 to a template just as Rails uses, say, an ERB template (you can actually use ERB in other contexts than views).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Treat the underlying ruby code as a systems automation tool which:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;operates over an array of dates from the past to the present&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;keeps track of what has been submitted to AWS Lambda&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reads the template in #3 and fills in the data based on the internal api.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;packages everything per the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/nodejs-create-deployment-pkg.html&quot;&gt;Lambda spec&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;uses the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/Aws/Lambda/Client.html&quot;&gt;AWS Lambda Ruby APIs&lt;/a&gt; to submit the job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this approach while we’re not using Lambda to actually execute our Ruby code, we’re getting the same result, using Lambda’s native JavaScript / node support but still using our overall Ruby framework to run everything and manage the process.  And this will have the advantage of generating an auditable code base that we can dig into if we find any problems.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>AWS Tutorial 19 - Back to the Basics, Let's Talk AMIs and EC2 basics</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I just used Hyde to examine my blog and I realized that I have written almost 20,000 words on AWS since 8/23/16 (note some of that is still unfinished and in draft form).  Using my standard writer metric of 250 words per page, that’s 78 printed pages.  Wow.  And, alas, I realize that there are still things I haven’t written about.  And some of them are the sort of basic things that you either just ignore or that you accept by rote - “I know, we’ll use Ubuntu, we love Ubuntu!”.  And, yes, that would be me.  So let’s take a deeper dive here at some of the basic options when you build an EC2 instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-an-ec2-instance&quot;&gt;What is an EC2 Instance?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An EC2 instance is just a server in Amazon’s cloud.  And, from what I can tell, pretty much everything AWS offers comes down to a server somehow.  When you build an EC2 instance you have to base it on an operating system which is called an AMI and there are a bunch of options that define what AMI you want to pick:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Quick Start - the most popular options&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My AMIs - these are amis that you have saved from a machine you already built&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;AWS Marketplace - these are commercial offerings from vendors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Community AMIs - these are generally open source AMIs and the number is enormous – more than 50,000 when I checked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a picture of the initial EC2 instance selection web page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/aws/aws_ami_ec2.png&quot; alt=&quot;aws_ami_ec2.png.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few basic options that you really want to keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linux Distro&lt;/strong&gt;.  This is important but can’t be written in a bullet point so it is discussed below.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;32 / 64 bit&lt;/strong&gt;.  There’s no real reason to not go 64 bit.  And if you have a reason then you should be writing this not reading it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Virtualization Type&lt;/strong&gt;.  This should always be HVM as PVM is being phased out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Root Device Type&lt;/strong&gt;.  This should pretty much always be set to EBS.  EBS allows you to turn off the volume without losing the data on the instance and thus allows you to resize your instance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-linux-distro-question&quot;&gt;The Linux Distro Question&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asking anyone in the Open Source world what is the best Linux flavor or “distro” (that’s short for distribution) is a bit like asking someone their favorite color – the answer is always different and always subjective.  And while there are differences, in the end, it is all Linux and if you can use one Linux then you can use a different Linux.  I know there are serious Linux folk that read this line and are gnashing their teeth and I apologize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally I’ve used at different times:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Red Hat&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gentoo (I even had a whole data center of more than 100 Gentoo boxes)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ubuntu 12&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ubuntu 14&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mandriva&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Suse&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Debian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’m pretty sure there were some others; that’s just want I can remember using.  The short answer is you want to pick a Linux distribution that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;matches what you want to do&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;is well supported&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;is something you understand&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;has a package manager that you can deal with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-amazon-linux-distribution&quot;&gt;The Amazon Linux Distribution&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly Amazon has their own Linux distribution.  I don’t have a ton of experience with it yet but I’m keenly interested in it and I really like their focus on performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Good support for Docker&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Good support for at least somewhat modern development tools; Ruby, PHP and Python all installed right from the start&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Good package support for the basics - mysql, postgres, etc&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;AWS command line tools installed standard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Good support for the AWS ECS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cool text mode EC2 login logo that makes me smile whenever I see it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They seem to really care about performance.  The 2016.09 release notes specifically call out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/2016.09-release-notes/&quot;&gt;7 seconds of boot time&lt;/a&gt; that they cut out.  Sounds silly but its a big deal when you have a lot of machines.  And given that they write the billing rules, they could easily use that 7 seconds in their favor.  The fact that they don’t gives me an incredible amount of confidence in AWS’s billing practices.  Go AWS!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It can’t run anywhere but Amazon.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It can’t run on Vagrant for local development&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yum / RPM as package managers; this is a personal choice but I vastly prefer apt-get&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-important-is-this-with-automated-provisioning&quot;&gt;How Important Is this With Automated Provisioning?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the days where you configured Linux manually, picking the right distribution was actually quite important.  Thanks to automated provisioning tools like Ansible, I’m not so sure now.  I’ve already used Ansible to move from one version of Linux to another and its just not that hard.  If you write your Ansible playbook properly and abstract things like the username into variables, you can modify it pretty easily to go between distros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end you likely want to pick:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A well supported Linux distro.  I’d recommend either Ubuntu, RedHat or the Amazon Linux AMI&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;64 Bit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;HVM Virtualization&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;EBS Root Device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>AWS Tutorial 18 - When You've Lost Your Web Server, How to Find an AWS Resource</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I find myself, at the time of this writing, in the middle of an embarrassing situtation for a web professional.  You see, the situation is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I wrote a new feature&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I deployed my new feature&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I refreshed my page&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My feature isn’t there&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great Googly Moogly!  I’ve lost my web server!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me explain one of the things about cloud hosting that’s disconcerting.  When you first move to the cloud, your impulse is to organize your computing resources the way you used to.  So if you used to have say 3 clusters of powerful machines, that’s what you do.  Then you realize just how mind blowingly powerful a platform like AWS actually is and you start to think about &lt;strong&gt;Single Purpose Servers&lt;/strong&gt;.  A single purpose server is just what it sounds like – it does one thing.  And that’s fantastic because it makes trouble shooting so much easier.  When a server does only one thing, well, its easy to know if its broken.  And that’s great but do you know what the side effect of that is?  You don’t have a handful of servers anymore, you have a lot.  Me?  I’ve got over &lt;strong&gt;20&lt;/strong&gt; right now.  And somewhere in there is my web server.  But I can’t find it.  In this tutorial we’re going to quickly and easily figure this out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;start-with-a-hypothesis&quot;&gt;Start with a Hypothesis&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As normal we’re going to start with a theory - that is one of these three boxes:  fimariadb, ficrawler1, ficrawler2.  So our diagnostic dance, crude tho it may be, is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ssh into one of the boxes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sudo su -&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;apache2ctl stop&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reload the page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the page comes up, well, we know it wasn’t that one box.  So you then lather, rinse, repeat for each of the other 2 boxes.  And, at the end, we’re going to find out that it was none of these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be saying “Hey wait a minute – why would a web front end be on a box that does crawling?”  Well I’m still feeling all this out and I initially went for the old model where every box could do everything.  And that was a bad decision but I still have to live it for at least a little while longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;formulate-a-new-hypothesis---lets-use-ping&quot;&gt;Formulate a New Hypothesis - Let’s Use Ping!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since our first plan failed, we need a new plan.  The program ping is a basic IP networking tool which lets us send a packet to a destination and if it answers, well, that means its alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ping banks.finavd.com
PING web-1166333941.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com (52.41.182.115): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 52.41.182.115: icmp_seq=0 ttl=47 time=67.589 ms
64 bytes from 52.41.182.115: icmp_seq=1 ttl=47 time=67.301 ms
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah ha!  We have an ip address of 52.41.182.115.  I know! I know!  I know!  I’ll just search for that ip address on EC2 dashboard.  And it will fail.  Now the smart kids in the back are already chuckling to themselves and they know the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;hypothesis-3-elb-is-being-used&quot;&gt;Hypothesis 3: ELB Is Being Used&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at the url that responded, NOT the ip address, the answer is revealed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;web-1166333941.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see the text string “.elb.”?  That means that a piece of software called an Elastic Load Balancer is sitting in front of the http request and distributing the load out to one or more EC2 instances.  If you’ve ever used HAProxy, well, ELB is that only far, far better.  Let’s goto the AWS Console and select the Load Balancers option from the choices on the left:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/aws/aws_elb_01_overview.png&quot; alt=&quot;aws_elb_01_overview.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we’ll see an overview of all of our load balancers and their basic settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/aws/aws_elb_02_instances.png&quot; alt=&quot;aws_elb_02_instances.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clicking the instances tab shows us where the HTTP request is being sent.  We can now goto the ec2 console and figure out what we need.  If you put the machine names into your &lt;a href=&quot;https://fuzzygroup.github.io/blog/aws/2016/09/20/aws-tutorial-08-using-ssh-s-config-file-with-your-aws-boxes.html&quot;&gt;SSH Config as I recommended&lt;/a&gt; then you might not even need to goto the console.  In my case I just needed to know the names worker2 and worker2a and I know that they’re in my ssh config file and I can just add those boxes to my Capistrano deploy process.  And the “bug” is fixed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion-and-suggestion&quot;&gt;Conclusion and Suggestion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that it must seem like I’m a bit of a buffoon – how can you lost a web server after all?  Well, things do happen when you move fast.  You start with one plan and then it doesn’t work and before you know it you have something working but its not where you originally planned.  And you mean to fix it but you get busy and then the next &lt;a href=&quot;https://fuzzygroup.github.io/blog/aws/2016/10/01/aws-tutorial-10-diagnosing-ssh-failures-or-when-ping-works-but-ssh-fails.html&quot;&gt;crisis&lt;/a&gt; happens and you’re not even in the same head space any more.  And by the time you return to it over 10 days have passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some suggestions for setting up your AWS architecture to avoid this kind of silliness:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Name things well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Name things logically.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the key value options when you set up your EC2 servers.  For example, having keys for both name and role might have helped.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remember that there are often abstractions around everything.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try and use single purpose servers from the start.  Yes the number of discrete servers increases complexity but their very single purpose nature makes debugging vastly easier.  And keep in mind that Amazon offers free servers.  Even a t2.micro free instance has 1 gig of ram and 8 gigs of storage.  I know that sounds funny but travel back in your head 5 years and that’s a beefy server and its &lt;strong&gt;FREE&lt;/strong&gt;.  If you’re just running something small, say Redis, Memcached, sendmail, etc that might be enough for a lot of applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>AWS Tutorial 17 - Wrapping Up Our SSH Issues By Using Monit For Process Monitoring</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So the solution to our SSH issues is actually fairly simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ruby code is using too much memory / cpu; memory leak?  bad code?  who knows.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A watchdog process needs to look out for processes using too many resources and shut them down so that the underlying init / service system can restart them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fuzzygroup.github.io/blog/ruby/2016/10/10/a-conversation-with-mike-perham.html&quot;&gt;Mike Perham&lt;/a&gt; helpfully pointed out the right approach to solving this - use a systems monitoring tool like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mperham/inspeqtor&quot;&gt;Inspeqtor&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://mmonit.com/monit/&quot;&gt;Monit&lt;/a&gt;.  I don’t normally do devops to the level that I am now so getting this perspective was key.  Given that its a 50 / 50 choice, I flipped a coin and chose Monit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the rest of this post, I’ll go over how I used Ansible to configure Monit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-role&quot;&gt;The Role&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing we need is a role for monit so we’re going to build out our role structure as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir -p your_ansible_root_path/roles/monit/tasks
mkdir -p your_ansible_root_path/roles/monit/templates
touch your_ansible_root_path/roles/monit/tasks/main.yml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we’re going to need a few things in our role (main.yml):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;---
- name: install monit
  apt: pkg=monit state=present
  
- name: start monit
  service: name=monit state=started

- name: install monit sidekiq config file
  template: src=roles/monit/templates/sidekiq.j2 dest=/etc/monit/conf.d/sidekiq
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our template for monitoring sidekiq is going to rely on a handful of variables that for simplicity’s sake, I’ve defined in the file all in groupvars:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;app_base: /var/www/apps/banks/
app_path: /var/www/apps/banks/current/
server_env: production
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I have sidekiq running on two different machines with different configurations, I used variables in the inventory file to define the number of threads and the max ram:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[crawler]
ficrawlerbig ansible_ssh_host=BLAH1.compute.amazonaws.com  ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/Users/sjohnson/.ssh/fi_nav_sitecrawl.pem  max_sidekiq_memory=&quot;50 GB&quot; max_sidekiq_threads=50
ficrawler3 ansible_ssh_host=BLAH2.compute.amazonaws.com ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/Users/sjohnson/.ssh/fi_nav_sitecrawl.pem max_sidekiq_memory=&quot;13 GB&quot; max_sidekiq_threads=25
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what that template looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;check process sidekiq
  with pidfile shared/tmp/pids/sidekiq.pid
  start program = &quot;cd  &amp;amp;&amp;amp; bundle exec ./bin/sidekiq -C ./config/sidekiq.yml -e &quot;
  
  stop program = &quot;/bin/bash -l -c 'cd  &amp;amp;&amp;amp; bundle exec sidekiqctl stop shared/tmp/pids/sidekiq.pid 10'&quot;
  if totalmem is greater than  for 3 cycles then restart
  
  if 3 restarts within 5 cycles then timeout
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here’s the playbook routine which calls the monit role:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;- { role: monit, tags: monit}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you put that all together, you’ll have monit watching the sidekiq process on a regular basis.  One thing I didn’t cover above is that we need to modify the config/sidekiq.yml file in the Rails root directory to use the right number of threads.  This is left as an exercise for the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion-to-this-series-of-posts-on-ssh-trauma-and-thank-you-time-2&quot;&gt;Conclusion to this Series of Posts on SSH Trauma and Thank You Time 2&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started this series of posts, 16 days ago, I really didn’t think all that much about SSH.  To an Internet developer, ssh is like &lt;em&gt;oxygen&lt;/em&gt;, you only notice it when it is &lt;strong&gt;gone&lt;/strong&gt;.  By having such a fundamental part of the infrastructure go away unexpectedly, it brought me new depths of understanding.  And, all of this occurred, while daily data processing and data crunching was going on.  Even with all the failures, our boxes stopped working.  Yes they would die periodically but I would just restart them while I explored my next hypothesis.  In the real world, business needs don’t stop even though things aren’t working correctly – you still have to get the job done.  And I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two people were absolutely essential to sorting this all out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nickjanetakis.com&quot;&gt;Nick Janetakis&lt;/a&gt;.  I initially met Nick thru his outstandingly excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.udemy.com&quot;&gt;Udemy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://nickjanetakis.com/courses/&quot;&gt;course on Docker&lt;/a&gt; and I’ve since gotten to know him a bit and hired him twice for &lt;a href=&quot;https://fuzzygroup.github.io/blog/aws/2016/10/06/aws-tutorial-14-diagnosing-ssh-failures-take-2.html&quot;&gt;ad hoc consulting&lt;/a&gt;.  Nick is a smart guy, knows Docker like the back of his hand and can think.  Thinking always sounds easy but it never is.  Recommended.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mikeperham.com&quot;&gt;Mike Perham&lt;/a&gt;.  I’ve known of Mike Perham’s work intellectually for years and years and always described him as &lt;em&gt;the best guy in known space for Ruby threading&lt;/em&gt;.  I only met him recently when we adopted sidekiq as a partial solution for this problem.  In Mike’s weekly Happy Hour where he provides &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; support to the Ruby community for Sidekiq, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fuzzygroup.github.io/blog/ruby/2016/10/10/a-conversation-with-mike-perham.html&quot;&gt;he correctly analyzed the problem and suggested a solution&lt;/a&gt;.  And you can bet that I’ve made sure that we purchased the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sidekiq.org/products/pro&quot;&gt;commercial version of Sidekiq&lt;/a&gt; in order to ensure that we have access to Mike should any future Sidekiq issues come up.  And don’t forget that the commercial version of Sidekiq includes more features as well as support.  Recommended as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you Nick; thank you Mike.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Brew XZ and Nokogiri and Tmux - An Unmitigated Disaster</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been one really, really bad day this past 24 hours.  While my AWS stability problems have gone away entirely, I had to get a new Rails code base up and running locally today, one done by another developer here.  This required Gem install and since it was Rails, that meant a Nokogiri install.  And I love what Nokogiri does but I &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;loathe&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;despise&lt;/em&gt; the installation process.  In every single repo I work on there is a top level docs directory and then a file called gems.txt which lists what I internally refer to as &lt;em&gt;the incantations&lt;/em&gt;.  These are those crap ass command lines that are so long you just can’t remember them.  Here’s the list of the tricks that I use to install Nokogiri when it inevitably fails:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;gem install nokogumbo -- --with-xml2-include=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.11.sdk/usr/include/libxml2 --use-system-libraries
gem install nokogiri -- --with-xml2-include=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.11.sdk/usr/include/libxml2 --use-system-libraries
gem install nokogiri -- --with-xml2-include=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.11.sdk/usr/include/libxml2 --use-system-libraries --with-pkg-config=/usr/local/bin/pkg-config
gem install nokogiri -- --with-xml2-include=/usr/local/opt/libxml2/lib --use-system-libraries --with-pkg-config=/usr/local/bin/pkg-config
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And not one of those worked.  The one that usually works without fail is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;gem install nokogiri -- --with-xml2-include=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.11.sdk/usr/include/libxml2 --use-system-libraries
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but not today.  I knew this was going to be a bad day.  I told the other guy here “your code, doesn’t install; give me solution”.  He found this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1483&quot;&gt;nugget of disturbing truth&lt;/a&gt;.  Apparently there is an incompatibility between Nokogiri and xz.  His suggestion was uninstall xz and I did that.  And Nokogiri was then fine – but I had to also reinstall ruby.   And that did work – until about an hour ago when I had a late night desire to write about Docker (hey - it is my Friday night; I can spend it however I please) – and I started getting this little gem of an error:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;jekyll post &quot;Learning From a Docker Captain - Nick Janetakis - Making AWS Monitor Run Under Docker&quot;
Your bundle is locked to i18n (0.7.0), but that version could not be found in any of the sources listed in your Gemfile. If you haven't changed sources, that means the author of i18n (0.7.0) has removed it. You'll need to update your bundle to a different version of i18n (0.7.0) that hasn't been removed in order to install.
Run `bundle install` to install missing gems.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this led to the inevitable cavalcade of swearing, muttering and normal gyrations when something absolutely essential to you is broken and you have no idea why.  Brew wouldn’t work, Gem wouldn’t work, Bundler wouldn’t work, etc.  Here was the problem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I run jekyll under a Tmuxinator/Tmux shell which runs the server in one window, runs the command line in another and a 3rd tab to remind me to migrate my old Radio Userland blog into Jekyll.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remember that ruby re-install?  Well Tmuxinator knows what the Ruby is and that ruby had gone away.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;So everything was trying to reference an executable that was no longer there and apparently the normal error for that is something about i18n.  Sheesh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I do get it, this was an exceptional set of circumstances but it still did cost me about half a man day on a day when I can ill afford it.  And it made me surly, nasty and unresponsive to my family and while that’s on me, that’s definitely not cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-to-do&quot;&gt;What to Do?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a hard one.  I rely on brew as does, well, every developer I know on OSX.  And since xz is a required part of brew (as well as the miraculous ag), getting rid of it is likely bad.  What I should have done is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;brew unlink xz BEFORE my nokogiri install&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;nokogiri install (with one of my incantations)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;brew link xz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, honestly, it is 2016 after all, doesn’t that feel, well, &lt;em&gt;dated&lt;/em&gt;?  I don’t know about anybody else out there but it feels like this is my Murtagh Moment, the &lt;em&gt;I’m too old for this shite&lt;/em&gt; point of a technology transition.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://nickjanetakis.com&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/a&gt; has been pushing me for a while to make the Docker transition for development and I think it is time.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://dasari.me&quot;&gt;Dv&lt;/a&gt; and I tried this back in 2014 and failed miserably at it but Docker is loads better now.  And since I can’t run my monitoring code on the machine that is permanently hooked up to the internet (again a Nokogiri failure), well, I guess I’ll make that work first and then figure this all out.  Sigh.  What a craptastic day here in the “what’s broken today world”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I am sure that this will get fixed at some point but the question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;when will it be fixed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;will I then even update to that version&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I move to Docker for my development then I skip the whole bundle install crap fest and everything will run under Linux.  I’m finding it harder and hard to object to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-great-docker-resource&quot;&gt;A Great Docker Resource&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obligatory disclaimer – Nick Janetakis is now a friend of mine.  But he is a bona fide Docker expert, a Docker Captain.  He also has a good course on &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/2ecakFU&quot;&gt;Docker for Devops&lt;/a&gt; hosted on Udemy.  he has a few others too but this one I’ve taken parts of and I know is excellent.  Recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Moving AWS Monitor to Docker or Troubleshooting Docker Bit By Bit</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So now that my monitoring code is actually working, I need to move it to my MacBook Pro.  Unfortunately this machine is, inexplicably, unable to natively install Nokogiri.  I’ve tried, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dasari.me&quot;&gt;Dv&lt;/a&gt; has tried and so has &lt;a href=&quot;http://winstonkotzan.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;.  And no matter what we do, it seems that this machine is just hosed for Rails development.  Or is it – I know what &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nickjanetakis.com&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/a&gt; would say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Docker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he’s a Docker Captain so he should know.  And while I’ve been a fan of Docker so far for treating almost any app as an API, I’ve never been a fan for my own code base.  But now its time.  Happily I did build this using my derivative of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nickjj/orats&quot;&gt;Nick’s Orats Gem&lt;/a&gt; so I’m actually ok as a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;getting-started-with-docker&quot;&gt;Getting Started with Docker&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step was to replace my docker-compose.yml with the official Orats one.  A quick trip over to github gave me this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;version: '2'

services:
  postgres:
    image: 'postgres:9.5'
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: 'orats_base'
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: 'yourpassword'
    ports:
      - '5432:5432'
    volumes:
      - 'postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data'

  redis:
    image: 'redis:3.2-alpine'
    command: redis-server --requirepass yourpassword
    ports:
      - '6379:6379'
    volumes:
      - 'redis:/var/lib/redis/data'

  website:
    depends_on:
      - 'postgres'
      - 'redis'
    build: .
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
    volumes:
      - '.:/orats_base'
    env_file:
      - '.env'

  sidekiq:
    depends_on:
      - 'postgres'
      - 'redis'
    build: .
    command: sidekiq -C config/sidekiq.yml.erb
    volumes:
      - '.:/orats_base'
    env_file:
      - '.env'

  cable:
    depends_on:
      - 'redis'
    build: .
    command: puma -p 28080 cable/config.ru
    ports:
      - '28080:28080'
    volumes:
      - '.:/orats_base'
    env_file:
      - '.env'

volumes:
  redis:
  postgres:
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for replacing it is that I had wanted to make a version of Orats with MySQL support but I never had the chance to finish it.  It is likely faster to use Nick’s postgres approach over my own half baked one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is to compile everything using docker-compose:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker-compose up --build
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now what happened next is a bit puzzling:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Installing pg 0.19.0 with native extensions

Gem::Ext::BuildError: ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

    current directory: /usr/local/bundle/gems/pg-0.19.0/ext

	--without-pg-include=${pg-dir}/include
	--with-pg-lib
	--without-pg-lib=${pg-dir}/lib

To see why this extension failed to compile, please check the mkmf.log which can be found here:

  /usr/local/bundle/extensions/x86_64-linux/2.3.0-static/pg-0.19.0/mkmf.log

extconf failed, exit code 1

Gem files will remain installed in /usr/local/bundle/gems/pg-0.19.0 for inspection.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now the question becomes how do you debug a Ruby gem failure inside a Docker container.  I honestly don’t know so I reached out to Nick for clarification:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I have to admit that I rushed thru this but that’s still not a reason – its an excuse.  Nick, in about a minute, pointed out that I was missing libpq so the Postgres gem wouldn’t build.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sidekiq - Graceful Versus Forceful</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So now that I’m using Sidekiq for background processes, I need to be able to start it up, shut it down and I need to understand the difference between forceful and graceful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;running-sidekiq-interactively&quot;&gt;Running Sidekiq Interactively&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is easy and we all should know this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd /my_rails_app/where_ever_that_is
bundle exec sidekiq
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will run Sidekiq interactively.  Now if you want it to run even if your connection to the remote box drops then you need to use Tmux or something similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;running-it-as-a-service&quot;&gt;Running it as a Service&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See my last blog post on using Ansible to configure Sidekiq and I think that will become clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;forceful-versus-graceful&quot;&gt;Forceful versus Graceful&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forceful versus Graceful defines how you want Sidekiq to shut down and it basically boils down to the speed of the shutdown.  Sidekiq runs “jobs” which basically means “long running methods” and here’s the difference:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;forceful – shut down NOW; abandon all work in process&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;graceful – tell sidekiq to shut down when each of its threads is done processing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s use an analogy here to make this clear.  Imagine that sidekiq was a hitchhiker you picked up on the side of the road.  Forceful would be you opening the door and kicking the hitchhiker out while the car is still moving.  Graceful would be you saying “I think you need to get out at the next exit and the hitchhiker saying - &lt;em&gt;I’m sorry but I need a bit more time; I’ll get out when I’m ready&lt;/em&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There isn’t a right answer here whether or not to use Forceful or Graceful – it really depends on your context.  If you use Sidekiq to handle short lived asynchronous tasks like, say, sending a welcome email then you probably want to use Graceful since it shouldn’t take that long for each thread to idle down.  I, on the other hand, use sidekiq to handle tasks that might take hours or even a whole day to finish so I usually use Forceful.  Given that my tasks have their own journal, this isn’t terrible.  It isn’t great but it isn’t terrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of a Forceful shutdown:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ps -ef | grep sidekiq | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of a Graceful shutdown:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ps auwwx | grep sidekiq  # and give the pid value to the next command where &amp;lt;pid&amp;gt; is
sidekiqctl stop &amp;lt;pid&amp;gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thanks to the fine community at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sidekiq.com/&quot;&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt; for these &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12143350/gracefully-shutting-down-sidekiq-processes&quot;&gt;Sidekiq Graceful answers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
