    <p>btw, random recording tips of the day: 1) disable all popup notficications / sounds , 2) cell phone in airplane mode , 3) close as much as you can on your machine to ensure you get a clean audio stream (nothing worse than getting a bunch of random hiccups and pops due to your system being overloaded at points)</p>

<p>what you got yesterday was around 3 weeks of hardcore audio research and testing in 5 minutesx`</p>

<p>there’s a lot of other reasons too, but they tend to produce other artifacts like pops and clicks
and if you thought debugging code was hard, debugging this shit is really difficult
i downloaded some tools to diagnosis these things on my computer
having one of your devices create a spike of usb usage for a few milliseconds at the wrong time could completely ruin your audio source at that moment</p>

<p>yeah maybe
i once talked to a low level audio guy, the type of guy who writes audio drivers
and he said random noises like that are almost always due to random interference – either at the cable level or wireless freqs</p>

<p>his could be line noise on the usb cable itself, or an artifact related to wireless interference
i’ve seen it happen on my end with cell phones
when recording for real, keep your phone in a different room
if you blog about this, definitely take a 10 second sample from the worst “before” to the next iteration (1-2 millimeters of more gain)’s “after” 10s</p>

<p>utting the drives in a trunk?
nope, there’s no more room noise at all now
it’s dead silent except for your voice
but it’s worth raising the gain knob up a millimeter or 2, because your levels are just a tiny bit below where they need to be
2:49 to 2:51 has a weird inserted high pitch frequency
it happens again at 2:56 for half a second</p>

<p>ok, i listened to various points of the view
*video
you have a lot of room noise in the audio
Ok. I bet that’s my hard drive array
I have a trunk I could seal that in
i feel like that blind guy on the movie Contact
just listening carefully
i can’t make out what it is, but it’s really loud – i don’t think udemy would even accept the video in its current form
but the fix is pretty easy with noise cancellation tactics
both pre-recording and post-editing
Ok. Will work on and share other videos w you
Thx
How to Remove Background Noise on Screenflow
How to Remove Background Noise on Screenflow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfvBmzxldnc
might want to play with that
Thx. I can’t wait for ssd s to hit the cheap terabyte leve
Level
yours does sound like a combination of fans and loud HDs
i just set up a sample for you
of my own recording, so you can test your headphones
https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzL8S6Xe9kCWUWhlbElleWgtaTQ
The bulk of the noise is the MacBook fan.  Killed firefox and almost every other process and will record a short clip to send you later and see if the background noise is still present.  I also added a towel under the mic.
I think part of the problem is I literally don’t hear it myself.  Probably an issue with low frequencies I’ve heard so long that they just don’t register
All the audio options are actually grayed out in screenflow so
Got it
if you can’t hear a massive difference in my audio you may need to change headphones
there’s a very apparent “hsssssssssssssssss” sound in the background when the filter is turned off
And actually you got the version with the internal mic.  I’m sending you a shorter one with the yeti mic and the noise reduction
it doesn’t sound like a computer fan because the mic doesn’t pick up distant sounds as they are exact, but there’s definite audio distortion
(no towel tho)
oh
the towel is to absorb your key presses?
because i did notice they were loud, but that’s also with the internal mic
The towel is under the mic but I can put one under the notebook
Sent
downloading it now
this is worse imo
the underlying quality of your voice is better, but there’s much more room noise
those popping sounds at 4:31ish are deafening too
i feel like a beaten dog when listening to this video, anticipating a whip on my back at any moment
Ok. Next step is to put the hard drives and plex box into a trunk
terrified of hearing those pops haha
the gain on your mic must be way up
Lol. Won’t give you anything until that’s done. Not sure about 4:31 but will figure it out
My kid last used it so no clue
ok, you need to adjust your yeti and then never touch it again
here’s what you do
on the back of your mic, there’s 2 knobs
the bottom one adjusts the recording pattern of the mic
since you’re effectively podcasting, you want to use the third icon, the one that looks like an upside down heart
that’s the cardoid pattern, it’s aimed for recording 1 voice in a controlled environment
the top knob is the gain, and i’m guessing yours is set way high
try setting the gain to about 10% (no joke, mine is set to this)
100% thanks to him
and it was set to the round setting not cardoid
changes made; cleaning garage and installing more storage; will podcast again later once I isolate the noisy box
Thx so much
round setting is the worst possible setting for  us
that’s omnidirectional, it’ll pick up everything in your room at every angle
Lol
Alas
cardoid just enables the mic pickups for directly in front of the mic
your recording has a subtle reverb and almost sounds like you’re in a fish bowl
but that’s 100% due to omnidirectional
when you set it to cardoid, it will tighten up your voice a lot and remove a lot of the “wishy washy” reverb
lowering the gain will really help to remove the keyboard thunder effect, but also it will drastically cut your volume out
Got it
right now your volume is clipping all over the place
i couldn’t even listen to it with my audio player’s volume past 30% or i would have gone deaf
your steps are: 1. set it to cardoid, 2. set the gain to maybe 5-10% , 3. record without making any physical changes, 4. send 1-2min sample to me
1 - done.  2 - done.  3 - recorded 1st 6 minutes of a screencast for them. This will force me to learn to edit with the timeline so bigger than you wanted but a start.
Sent
checking
night and day difference
you can up the gain ever so slightly if you wanted, we’re talking 2-3% here, a millimeter more
if you went from a ton of room noise and in an echo chamber with a lot of distortion to a very reasonable recording, where this will pass udemy’s tests for sure
Ok. Am I getting to udemy quality yet ?
*you went from
thx
your key presses are a bit loud, but i would say the mic settings are good at this point
