    <h1 id="background">Background</h1>

<p>I’ve taken on a new project recently.  I’m helping teach some local (Indianapolis) homeless youth basic software engineering using the web developer curriculum from <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com">Free Code Camp</a>.  Initially I’m teaching two students and we’re working out of the <a href="https://outreachindiana.org/">Outreach Indiana</a> facility in downtown Indianapolis.  Outreach Indiana is a fantastic charity that truly does good work.</p>

<p>I thought I’d write a series of essays on How to Be a Developer that reflect some of the things I’ve learned over a career working in high tech.  While I am a fan of what Free Code Camp does, I thought some practical, hands on advice might add some value for my students.  I’ve structured these as a series of single topic narratives arranged numerically.</p>

<h1 id="lesson-012---vocabulary">Lesson 012 - Vocabulary</h1>

<p>One of the very best decisions I ever made took place in a Walden Books, an old fashioned bookstore, where I purchased an issue of Byte magazine:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/byteapril82.jpg" alt="byteapril82.jpg" /></p>

<p>I was 14 years old.</p>

<p>That issue of Byte magazine was probably 450 pages or so in length and I understood maybe 1 word in 10, possibly as few as 1 word in 50 (I did pretty well with pronouns and articles).  When you’re 14 years old and you see articles like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An introduction to two common interfaces between computers and other devices</li>
  <li>Designing the Star User Interface</li>
  <li>A Disk Operating System for FORTH, An In-depth Look at How a DOS Operates</li>
  <li>You can trim text size by 40 percent by encoding common character strings</li>
  <li>Texas Instruments’ SN76832AN Infrared Remote-Control Receiver simplifies the tough job of receiving modulated infrared light.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Sidebar:</strong> Thank you <a href="https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1982-04">Archive.org</a> for putting my proto history online; Appreciated!</p>

<p>well, there just isn’t a lot that you’re going to understand out of the gate but what Byte magazine did for me was give me a <em>vocabulary</em>.  Just after reading thru that issue, I knew:</p>

<ul>
  <li>that <em>Forth</em> was a language where you made your own “words”</li>
  <li>that <em>interfaces</em> were important</li>
  <li>that user interfaces could be <em>more than text menus</em> (remember 1982 – pre Lisa, pre Macintosh)</li>
  <li>that text could be compressed with <em>encoding</em> (even if I didn’t understand all of it)</li>
</ul>

<p>As a budding developer, one of the hardest things isn’t actually the coding, it is being just <em>aware of <strong>everything</strong></em>.  Computing is a vast field with so much going on in it that you’ll generally find that you’re doing something that someone else has already solved.  But if you don’t even have vocabulary to know that something exists, how can you even Google for it?  In 1982 Byte magazine gave me that vocabulary, but, times change and there is no more Byte magazine so what is a new developer to do?</p>

<p>My advice, to channel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Graduate">The Graduate</a>, is one world: <em>Podcasts</em> (apologies if you miss the reference - look for “plastic”).  Podcasts are (generally) free audio streams on the Internet that you can put on a mobile device or your desktop and listen to at your leisure.  There are a huge number of developer podcasts but the one I always recommend is <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/">Software Engineering Daily</a>, also known as SE Daily, by Jeff Atwood.  In the same way that Byte magazine once exposed me to things I had no idea about, I find that today from SE Daily.  Here are some of the things that I learned about in the past month from SE Daily:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Web Assembly</li>
  <li>IOT Edge</li>
  <li>Setting Up Your Own ServerLess Cluster</li>
  <li>Video Object Segmentation</li>
  <li>Relay Modern</li>
  <li>“Cloud Native”</li>
  <li>Convolutional Neural Networks</li>
</ul>

<p>None of these were terms that I had ever encountered (neural nets, yes, convolutional, no) and each of them, covered in about an hour, expanded my understanding.  Am I an expert?  Of course not but what I now have is the knowledge that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>this thing exists</li>
  <li>what type of problem it helps me solve</li>
  <li>where I might learn more</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re just starting out as a developer, I think there’s probably no better way to expand your vocabulary than a solid developer podcast like Software Engineering Daily.  Recommended.</p>
