<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm a software engineer and I am decidedly <strong>not</strong> a marketing guy (I play one on the Internet from time to time but I really just write code).  I recently launched a side project, <a href="https://www.jobhound.io">Job Hound</a>, that had an unexpectedly successful first day and I thought documenting it might help someone out there (and certainly help me; that's usually why I blog anything; it helps me understand things).</p>

<h1 id="what-is-job-hound">What is Job Hound?</h1>

<p>Job Hound is a tool that I wrote recently as a way to "make getting a tech job suck less".  I recently went out to get a full time gig and I found the process <a href="http://fuzzyblog.io/blog/jobhound/2018/04/24/ten-things-i-learned-from-a-job-hunt-for-a-senior-engineering-role.html">just so plain awful</a> so I wrote software as a way to put myself in control of it.  After finding it incredibly useful for my own needs, and then showing it a few friends to positive feedback, I figured that I'd throw it on a cheap Digital Ocean box and see what happened.</p>

<h1 id="timing-for-metrics">Timing for Metrics</h1>

<p>I'm writing this after the first 16 hours the product was live.  All marketing activities were done around 8 am EST.  There's a bit in the Metrics section that gives the numbers after a full 24 hours but this was initially written at the 16 hour mark and then published a few days later.</p>

<h1 id="my-launch-plan">My Launch "Plan"</h1>

<p>Last week an article on <a href="https://work.qz.com/1254663/job-interviews-for-programmers-now-often-come-with-days-of-unpaid-homework/">Quartz talking about the rise in homework for job seekers</a> took off on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16874015">Hacker News</a> with 989 comments.</p>

<p>Here was my launch plan:</p>

<p><strong>My friend <a href="https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/">Nick</a></strong>:  You should document your story on your struggle to find a job and then post it on Hacker News</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: Ok.</p>

<p>Honestly there wasn't more to it than that.  This isn't a humblebrag by any means.  Someone I respect suggested it and, well, that is how it started.</p>

<p>I had about 500 words of a very crufty blog post in draft form right in my coding editor so I polished that up from 5 am to 7 am and that became my <a href="http://fuzzyblog.io/blog/jobhound/2018/04/24/ten-things-i-learned-from-a-job-hunt-for-a-senior-engineering-role.html">Ten Things I Learned from a Job Hunt for a Senior Engineering Role</a> blog post.  I also submitted it to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16912546#16913834">Hacker News</a> where over the course of the next 16 hours, it got 638 comments.</p>

<p>I should point out that this is the first thing I've ever submitted to Hacker News that has gotten <strong>any</strong> traction at all.</p>

<p>I did tweet my blog post on <a href="https://twiiter.com/fuzzygroup/">my personal twitter</a> and I also made a Job Hound specific tweet and then pinned the Job Hound tweet so it stayed at the top of my twitter feed.</p>

<p>I honestly never even thought to put my blog post on Facebook.  I did that 24 hours later so I don't have any metrics on that.</p>

<p>My final launch action, one I had no hope for at all, was that I also tossed Job Hound up on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/job-hound">Product Hunt</a> where it got 56 up votes during roughly the same period (it may have been on Product Hunt 1 day longer; the whole day is kind of a blur right now).</p>

<h1 id="fine-tuning">Fine Tuning</h1>

<p>I did relatively little tuning of the content.  My buddy Nick suggested that I emphasize the free nature of Job Hound in the blog post and that I add the Product Hunt link into the blog post.  Both of these were good ideas and done around 2 pm EST.</p>

<h1 id="the-metrics">The Metrics</h1>

<p>Since roughly 8 am this morning (sixteen hours so far), Job Hound has had:</p>

<ul>
  <li>204 user accounts created (email / password)</li>
  <li>98 jobs added</li>
  <li>An average of 0.48 jobs per user</li>
</ul>

<p>After a full 24 hours, the numbers were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>236 user accounts created (email / password)</li>
  <li>119 jobs added</li>
  <li>An average of 0.50 jobs per user</li>
</ul>

<p>In terms of social media metrics, I started the day with 163 twitter followers and I ended it a full 24 hours later with 187.</p>

<p>Are these numbers good?  I think that absolutely depends on your perspective.  For a side project that I publicly launched with absolutely zero planning – I'm absolutely delighted.</p>

<p><strong>Followup after 4 days</strong>: The numbers have continued to steadily grow and I've gotten quite a few emails, linked in messages, tweets and other feedback that all indicates to me that I have hit on something.  My plan is that keep working Job Hound as a side project and just making it better and better.  Maybe something comes of this; maybe not but helping people get jobs is a <strong>good</strong> thing.</p>

<h1 id="other">Other</h1>

<p>I received a number of emails and messages via LinkedIn and I tried to respond to everyone on the same day.  I've always found that talking to users is the best damn marketing you can do.  This is the root of the <a href="https://www.jobhound.io/pages/thank_you">Job Hound Thank You</a> page.</p>

<p>You're probably wondering "what about the web traffic?"  I'm sorry to say that my Google Analytics skills just aren't all that good so I haven't been able to dig into them with any success as of yet.  I'm sure the data is there but I'm too brain dead to figure it out.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion---content-does-work">Conclusion - Content Does Work</h1>

<p>I think my overall conclusions from all this are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Creating content on the Internet as a marketing tool really does work but the content has to have value of its own.  You can't simply shill your product; embed it in something that is interesting all on its own.</li>
  <li>Telling a personal story works.</li>
  <li>Lucky is better than smart.  I was extremely lucky in getting coverage from Hacker News.</li>
  <li>Timing matters.  I was lucky to be able to ride a wave of hiring interest from the Quartz article.  This didn't occur to me and it took the pushing of a good friend for me to put this out.  Thanks Nick.</li>
</ul>
