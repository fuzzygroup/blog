Hi.  Thanks for stopping by.  I'm Scott Johnson, an Indianapolis based husband, father and software engineer.  You might know me from some of the things I've done in the past:

* [FI-Navigator](http://www.fi-navigator.com)
* [AppData](http://www.appdata.com/)
* eduFire
* Feedster
* Mascot Network
* Dataware II KMS
* NTERGAID / HyperWriter

As well as lots and lots of other consulting work and projects over the years.  I've started companies, bought companies, sold companies, failed at companies, etc.  Most of all though I do really love to write software.  Day in and day out I write code.

Here I am on the web:

* [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/409644/fuzzygroup?tab=answers)
* [Github](https://github.com/fuzzygroup)
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fuzzygroup)
* [Medium](https://medium.com/@fuzzygroup/)

These days I work almost exclusively in Ruby and Rails although I find [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) intriguing as heck.  I'm not there yet on production work but its probably the most promising language I've touched in years.  I'm also starting to experiment with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) as a way out of statically built, typed languages.
